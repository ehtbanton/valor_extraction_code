THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of\nup to $8,100,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $4,800,000; and (ii) a B loan of up to $3,300,000\nto Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited (the borrower) for the Prime Road\nNational Solar Park Project in Cambodia. The report also describes the proposed administration\nof a loan of up to $4,200,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector\nin Asia II (CFPS II)1 for the Prime Road National Solar Park Project, and if the Board approves\nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the\nadministration of the CFPS II loan.\n2. The limited recourse project finance loan will support the borrower in developing and\noperating a 60-megawatt alternating current (MWac) solar photovoltaic power plant in Kampong\nChhnang Province, in Cambodia (the project). The project is the culmination of a One Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) effort over several years to develop a solar park in Cambodia involving\nthe Southeast Asia Department (SERD), the Sustainable Development and Climate Change\nDepartment, the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, and the Private Sector Operations\nDepartment (PSOD). Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited was awarded the\nproject through a competitive reverse auction tender process that resulted in the lowest utility-\nscale solar tariff in Southeast Asia at the time: $0.03877 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The ADB loan\nwill meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-tenor, United States dollar-denominated project\nfinancing, which local financial institutions are unable to provide. ADB has led the transaction and\nwill mobilize more than $5 of cofinancing from commercial, development finance, and\nconcessional sources for every $1 of ADB investment. CFPS II concessional financing helped\ncontribute to a financially viable bid result with a competitive tariff. The project will contribute to\nADB\u2019s climate change mitigation efforts by reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions in the\nenergy sector by 110,700 tons per year. Classified effective gender mainstreaming, the project\nwill also promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in Cambodia.\nII. THE PROJECT\nA. Project Identification and Description\n1. Project Identification\n3. Since the early 1990s, Cambodia has enacted wide-ranging reforms and transformed itself\nfrom a country beset by 3 decades of civil conflict and instability to a high-growth, market-oriented\neconomy. Its economic growth reached an average rate of 6.4% from 2009 to 2019,2 and the\npoverty rate fell substantially from 30.1% in 2009 to 12.9% in 2018.3 The household electrification\nrate also increased significantly from 19% in 2009 to 75% in 2019.4\n4. Total electricity demand grew from 2,077 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2009 to 12,015 GWh\nin 2019, and is expected to reach 24,184 GWh by 2025 under a medium-growth scenario that\nADB helped prepare for Cambodia\u2019s Power Development Master Plan (2020\u20132040).5 While the\n1 Financing partner: The Government of Canada, as represented by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and\nDevelopment (\u201cDFATD\u201d).\n2 ADB. 2020.

Manila (TA 9600-REG).\n2\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic will likely lead to a deceleration of this growth\ntrajectory, pre-crisis growth patterns are expected to reemerge in tandem with an eventual\neconomic recovery.\n5. Cambodia\u2019s power supply still depends heavily on hydropower, coal, diesel, and imports\nfrom neighboring countries. Its installed capacity totaled 2,756 megawatts (MW) at the end of\n2019, of which hydropower accounted for the largest share (48%), followed by coal (24%).\nCambodia relies on a further 627 MW of cross-border capacity from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic, Thailand, and Viet Nam. However, solar is a promising renewable energy source in\nCambodia, potentially complementing hydropower resources and reducing reliance on coal and\ndiesel generation. The country enjoys some of the highest solar resources in the Greater Mekong\nSubregion, with solar irradiance measuring on average 1,400 kWh\u20131,800 kWh per square meter\nper year throughout the country, for an estimated technical potential of more than 8,000 MW.6\n6. In June 2016, the Government of Cambodia received approval from the multidonor climate\ninvestment funds for an investment plan under the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy for Low-Income\nCountries Program. The program investment plan in Cambodia included $21.3 million to\naccelerate solar power through both the public and private sectors.7 In 2016, ADB also approved\na loan to support the first utility-scale solar project in Cambodia, the Bavet solar project.8 The\nsuccess and experience with this project helped Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), the national\nutility, get more comfortable with intermittent solar resources.\n7. In 2017, at the government\u2019s request, SERD developed a preliminary national solar\nphotovoltaic grid integration study and road map for EDC. Following this study, SERD presented\nthe idea of a large-scale solar park to EDC, to promote solar at scale and help EDC gain\nexperience in procuring power from the private sector through transparent and competitive\nprocesses, using standardized legal and commercial agreements. In 2019, ADB approved the\nCambodia National Solar Park Project, which will be able to accommodate at least 100 MWac of\nsolar photovoltaic capacity and consists of 150\u2013200 hectares (ha) of land, fencing, drainage,\nroads, and plant buildings, a substation, and a transmission line.9 The solar park will also host the\nfirst utility-scale pilot battery energy storage installation in Cambodia with up to 16 megawatt-\nhours of capacity.10 Transaction advisory services provided by ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private\nPartnership to EDC helped prepare and conduct a competitive reverse auction11 tender to procure\nthe first 60 MWac of power from the solar park which has culminated in this project. The remaining\n40 MWac of capacity in the solar park will be tendered in a second phase.12\n8. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.\n2. Project Design\n9. The project is in Kampong Chhnang Province 70 kilometers from the capital, Phnom Penh,\none of the main electricity demand centers in Cambodia responsible for about 70% of the national\nelectricity demand. To provide 60 MWac of power to the grid, the borrower will install 78 MW of\n6 ADB. 2018. Cambodia Energy Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Roadmap. Manila.\n7 Government of Cambodia. 2016.

Cambodia: Grid Reinforcement Project.\n11 A reverse auction is a competitive tender in which the bidder with the lowest price is awarded the project.\n12 The land, substation, and transmission line comprising the Cambodia: National Solar Park Project are sized to allow\nfor the effective evacuation of 100 MWac of power.\n3\ndirect current solar photovoltaic capacity using innovative bifacial13 modules and a single-axis\ntracking mounting system, features that help increase energy generation and decrease the cost\nper kWh.\n10. The project represents phase 1 of the planned 100 MWac Cambodian National Solar Park\nProject (footnote 9 and footnote 12), the first large-scale solar park in Southeast Asia and an\nimportant One ADB initiative. The sponsor won the project through a competitive international\nbidding process among 26 short-listed participants. PSOD supported 20 of the bidders with a\nletter of support and indicative term sheet. The project achieved the then lowest utility-scale solar\ntariff in Southeast Asia of $0.03877 per kWh. This will help lower the electricity price in Cambodia,\nwhich is among the highest in the region.14 The project company has entered into a 20-year power\npurchase agreement (PPA) with EDC, the state-owned utility, to supply 60 MWac of power to the\ndesignated EDC substation inside the solar park. EDC will provide the project land. EDC is also\nbuilding a dedicated transmission line for the solar park with ADB sovereign assistance.\n11. Cambodia has policies on both renewable energy and gender equality, but these are not\nintegrated or mutually conducive. In energy-related public sector operations, men still tend to\ndominate the technical and managerial roles, while women are typically hired into finance and\naccounting functions. This is particularly true across the lower Mekong region.15 The low literacy\nand education levels of women in the workforce, combined with attitudes toward gender roles that\nemphasize women as \u201clower status\u201d and \u201chousehold managers,\u201d limit their livelihood alternatives\nor opportunities for higher-level occupations and decision-making positions.16\n3. The Borrower and Sponsor\n12. The borrower is Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited, a special-purpose\nvehicle incorporated in Cambodia to implement the project. It will be about 100%17 owned by\nPrime Road Alternative Company Limited (Prime Road Alternative, the sponsor), a pioneering\nsolar energy system developer in Thailand and a part of the Prime Road Group.\n13. Prime Road Group is an investment group based in Thailand with diversified interests in\nrenewable energy, real estate, and waste management, and a regional focus in Asia and the\nPacific. The group is a new client for ADB. Prime Road Power Public Company Limited is the\ninvestment holding company for the group\u2019s renewable energy business (holding 100% interest in\nthe sponsor) with a market capitalization of B8.0 billion as of 3 November 2020. CONFIDENTIAL\nINFORMATION DELETED. The group has a 7-year track record in the development, construction,\nand operations of solar power plants; its total portfolio of 286 MW consists of 22 projects in\noperation with an installed capacity of 178 MW, and four projects under development and\nconstruction with an aggregate capacity of 108 MW.\n14.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts. While Cambodia reported relatively few\nCOVID-19 cases, the virus-induced global economic slowdown will affect its three most important\nindustries\u2014construction, tourism, and apparel exports\u2014which account for more than 70% of\neconomic growth and almost 40% of total employment.18 ADB estimates that Cambodia\u2019s\neconomic growth will be negative in 2020, before returning to a positive growth rate of nearly 6%\nin 2021.19 Reports suggest that COVID-19 has affected power demand in the first half of 2020.20\nHowever, it has not had any material impact on the project\u2019s progress.\nB. Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs\n17. Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) exploration and development\nof environmentally and socially acceptable energy resources needed to supply all sectors of\nCambodia's economy encouraged, and (ii) renewable energy to reduce Cambodia\u2019s greenhouse\ngas emissions promoted.\n18. Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: energy generated from renewable\nsources increased.\n19. Outputs. The project has four outputs: (i) a new solar power plant constructed, (ii) local\nemployment with enhanced gender equality generated, (iii) gender equality of employment\nstrengthened, and (iv) gender equality in the community increased.\nC. Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations\n20. Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with\nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which outlines seven operational priorities to tackle the development\nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific.21 The project supports three of them: (i) tackling climate\nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (ii)\naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; and (iii) accelerating progress in gender\nequality. It also supports Strategy 2030\u2019s objectives to expand the role of private sector\noperations, mobilize additional resources on top of ADB\u2019s own financing, and deliver $80 billion\nof cumulative climate financing by 2030. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership\nstrategy, 2019\u20132023 for Cambodia, which calls for continued ADB investment into renewable\nenergy in support of sustainable and inclusive growth.22\n21. Consistency with sector strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which\nsupports wider access to energy through investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy\nprojects.23 Consistent with the One ADB approach, the project benefitted from close coordination\nwith ADB\u2019s SERD in assessing and analyzing Cambodia\u2019s energy sector.\n22.

Because of concerns about political risk and the nascent state of the local banking sector,\nobtaining long-term financing necessary for infrastructure investments remains a challenge in\nCambodia. ADB\u2019s lead role in the transaction helps to mobilize a comprehensive long-term\nfinancing package for a landmark renewable energy project in the region. Its early engagement\nin the project and its ability to catalyze long-term loans from a variety of sources, including a\ncommercial bank, gave bidders more confidence that debt finance would be available, thereby\ncontributing to lower tariff bids.\n29. ADB\u2019s strong support at all stages of the project will demonstrate the benefits of\ntransparent and competitive bidding, long-term financing, and clean energy at scale. It also\nhighlights the potential to develop Cambodia\u2019s power supply through low-cost public\u2013private\npartnership arrangements from domestic renewable energy sources, providing an alternative to\ncoal-fired generation. A successful implementation will show that solar power infrastructure\nprojects can be developed in a transparent manner, while achieving very competitive tariffs at\nlevels well below grid parity even in frontier markets that are perceived as more challenging.\nADB\u2019s involvement also helped enhance the project\u2019s environmental and social management\npractices, including stronger gender benefits.\nC. Risks\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.\nIV. POLICY COMPLIANCE\nA. Safeguards and Social Dimensions\n30. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified\ncategory B for environment, category C for involuntary resettlement, and category C for\nindigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been\nidentified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse\nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans.\n31. An independent consultant prepared an initial environmental and social examination\nreport for the project. No protected areas or particularly sensitive environmental receptors were\nidentified within or adjacent to the project site. The potential environmental impacts (e.g., noise,\nvibration, dust, waste generation, ground contamination, and soil erosion) are generally\nassociated with construction activities. These impacts are considered to be site-specific and short-\nterm, and can be effectively managed by implementing good engineering, construction, and\nproject management practices as well as preventive and control measures reflected in the World\nBank Group\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety General Guidelines, and detailed in the site-\nspecific environmental management plans. Occupational health and safety risks will be mitigated\nthrough the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, monitoring,\nand the provision of personal protective equipment. Environmental and occupational health and\nsafety provisions, consistent with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement, will be\nincorporated into the contractor agreements.\n7\n32. The project does not require involuntary resettlement, and no distinct and vulnerable\nindigenous people groups were identified in the area. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nDELETED.\n33. The borrower will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection\nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor\nstandards. The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance\nwith such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. The borrower will annually submit a safeguards and\nsocial monitoring report that will include information on the project\u2019s compliance with the\nSafeguard Policy Statement. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will\nfollow ADB requirements.25\n34. Effective gender mainstreaming. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.\nFollowing ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), the borrower has incorporated\nmeasures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities.\nKey features of the gender action plan include (i) increasing gender inclusiveness in its\nprocurement, (ii) taking on female interns in technical roles, (iii) implementing an anti-sexual\nharassment policy, and (iv) delivering a community project that caters to women\u2019s needs. The\nborrower will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB.\n35. Climate change impact. The project will supply Cambodia\u2019s electricity grid with solar\npower and help reduce 110,700 tons of carbon dioxideper annum by 2023.\nB. Anticorruption Policy\n36. Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of\nimplementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and\nthe financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate\nprovisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for\nADB in the event of noncompliance.\nC. Investment Limitations\n37. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.\nD. Assurances\n38. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),26\nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of\nCambodia has no objection to the proposed assistance to Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia)\nCompany Limited. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance\nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors.\nV. RECOMMENDATION\n39.

The National Solar Park (NSP) Project of Electricite du Cambodge (EDC) involves the\ncontruction of two phases totaling 100-megawatt (MW) capacity in Kampong Chhnang\nprovince and transmission connection to the Phnom Penh demand center to supply power to\nthe national grid. This impact assessment is for the design, construction and operation of the\nfirst phase involving a 60 MW power plant \"Project\" for the NSP by a private contractor Prime\nRoad Alternative (Cambodia) Co. Ltd. (hereafter referred to as PRAC). This assessment is\nrequired by lenders in their appraisal of PRAC\u2019s proposed loan to finance the Project.\n2. The NSP is the first of its kind in Cambodia and builds on lessons learnt from ADB\nPrivate Sector Operations Department\u2019s financing of a 10 MW solar power plant at Bavet, Svay\nRieng Province in 2016. Building on the Bavet project, the NSP aims to demonstrate the ability\nof large-scale solar parks to produce solar energy at a competitive price while also providing\ntechnical benefits to the national grid and substitute for planned fossil fuel and hydropower\ngeneration in the future.1 The NSP will build appreciation for the costs, operational\nrequirements and actual performance of solar PV plants.\n3. The government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy, Phase IV (2018\u20132023), highlights increased\ninvestment in solar energy to reduce electricity costs and ensure long-term energy security.2\nThe government has also prioritized the development of renewable energy in its National\nStrategic Development Plan 2014\u20132018 in order to meet the growing demand for electricity\nin Phnom Penh and address the country\u2019s electrification target of 100% of villages by 2020.3\nIn addition, the government\u2019s Industrial Development Policy 2015\u201320254 identifies the\nhistorically high power tariffs in the country as a major impediment to the competitiveness of\nthe country\u2019s manufacturing sector, and calls for alternate sources of energy to be developed.\nFurthermore, Cambodia\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution, enshrined in the 2015 Paris\nAgreement5, commits to a 16% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a business\nas usual scenario by 2030 from the energy sector.6 Ideally, alternate, clean sources of energy\nwould complement installed and planned hydropower-based generation, which is often\ninadequate during the dry season, as well as help provide ancillary benefits to the grid around\nthe key demand centers.\n1 Technical or ancillary benefits include: (i) voltage support during peak loading periods, (ii) reduction of loading levels on\ntransformers, (iii) and reduction of the amount of power that needs to be generated from distant sources (hydro and coal,\nin particular) and therefore reduction of losses in the transmission system.\n2 Government of Cambodia. 2018.

The PRAC\u2019s Project Management Office (PMO) will be responsible for day-to-\nday coordination specifically for its 60MW solar plant and will be the principal liaison with the\nNSP\u2019s Project Implementation Consultant (referred to as the NSP PIC). PRAC\u2019s PMO will be\nsupported by the Consultant Team to be engaged to handle social and environmental issues\nunder its PMO\u2019s Social and Environmental Compliance Unit (SECU). With the oversight of NSP\nPIC, the SECU will be responsible for 60MW solar plant\u2019s overall supervision and coordination\nduring project implementation and ensure consistency of all safeguards documents with\nlender requirements, government policy, legal and administrative framework.\n5. PRAC will build, own, operate and maintain the 60MW portion of the NSP and all\ns\ninfrastructure installed under the Project, as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) with a\nlong-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Electricity du Cambodge (EDC).\nProject Location\n6. The 60MW solar plant covers an area of 97 ha within the planned 250 ha NSP and is\nlocated in Tuek Phos district of Kampong Chhnang province.\nProject Impacts, Outcome and Outputs\n7. The project is aligned with the Government\u2019s stated impact of lower electricity cost in\nCambodia.7 The project outcome will be increased private sector investments in solar PV in\nCambodia.\n8. Climate Resilience \u2013 A climate risk and vulnerability analysis (CRVA) of the 60 MW solar\nplant is covered by the NSP study (IEE) which is classified as being at medium risk from future\nclimate change impacts. Based on this study, the key climate change impacts in the region\nwould be extreme rainfall events causing flooding and precipitation induced landslides. While\nclimate change impacts are not anticipated to be significant over the design life of the solar\npark (+20 years) as well as the 60 MW solar plant, the preliminary design integrates flood\nresilience measures such as ensuring solar park (and 60MW solar plant) are raised above the\nhighest flood level, strengthening existing drainage canals and building a storm water\nretention pond. Regular maintenance of drainage canals, storm water retention pond and\naccess roads will be carried out to ensure their ongoing effective operation. Flood resilience\nmeasures that will permanently become part of the 60 MW solar plant is included within the\ndesign.\n9. Land purchase \u2013the PRAC will lease 97 ha for 60MW PV plant from EDC, which\nreported that it purchased the land through commercial negotiations and on a willing buyer\nwilling seller basis.8\nLenders (ADB and IFC) and Domestic Environmental Requirements\n7 Government of Cambodia. 2015. Cambodia Industrial Development Policy 2015\u20132025: Market Orientation and Enabling\nEnvironment for Industrial Development. Phnom Penh.\n8 One MW requires 1.5 to 2.5 ha of land; Source: Cambodia Solar Park Feasibility Study, 2018. The land requirements for\neach phase are not scaled by MW; however, the total requirement for 100 MW will be met with 250 ha.\n10. The 60MW solar plant requires an environmetal and social impact assessment (ESIA)\nand environmental and social management plan (ESMP). The ESIA and ESMP cover\nenvironmental and social impacts and risks in the project area of influence9 of the solar PV\nplants10, as per the definitions in ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and World Bank\nGroup General Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) (2007), IFC Performance Standards\n(2012). The ESIA and ESMP have been prepared based on the detailed design of the 60MW\nsolar plant.\n11. The project will also comply with the Government Sub-decree No.72 on Environmental\nImpact Assessment (EIA) issued on 11 August 1999. Full EIA (FEIA) is required for the 60 MW\nsolar plant construction.\nProject Benefits\n12. This project is expected to have significant environmental benefits. A transition to\nclean energy sources (i.e. solar energy generation) will limit import dependence on coal and\nother fossil fuels, delay or defer construction of new coal-fired plants and reduce reliance on\nhydropower generation11.This would contribute to national emission reduction targets12 and\nreduce pollution impacts.\n13. The operation of a 60 MW solar PV plant will avoid approximately 84,000 tons of\ncarbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO2e) annually. For a lifetime, the project will contribute to the\nreduction of emssions upto 1,760,000 tCO2e.\nAnticipated Adverse Environmental and Social Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n14. Environmental impacts were assessed for the project area of influence across all stages\nof project implementation, i.e. (i) design and pre-construction stage, (ii) construction stage,\nand (iii) operation stage.\n15. During Design and Pre-Construction. The potential adverse environment impacts\nassociated with the Project have been avoided or minimized through careful site selection for\nthe solar plant. The migitation measures are included in the detailed engineering design.\nMeasures include: (i) ensuring final site to avoid sensitive receptors including protected areas,\nhabitats and species of conservation value, hospitals/clinics/schools and physical cultural\nresources (PCRs) as well as minimizing impacts on human health, households and crops and\ntrees of economic value, (ii) orientations for the PRAC\u2019s contractors about environmental\nmanagement and performance during the work; (iii) permits and clearances for the site, (iv)\nintegration of design features for climate risks and effective environmental management, (v)\nconducting meaningful consultations, environmental baseline and seasonal surveys, and (vi)\n9 For the purposes of establishing the environmental baseline and assessing the potential environmental impacts, the area\nof influence for impacts from the proposed 60 MW solar plant is taken as 1-3km radius and this area is primarly assessed.\n10 ADB SPS 2009 requires that assessment encompasses associated facilities that are not funded as part of the project\n(funding may be provided separately by the borrower or by third parties), and whose viability and existence depend\nexclusively on the project and whose goods or services are essential for successful operation of the project.\n11 Cambodia now has a surplus of power generation in some hours in wet periods and at nighttime. Yet the national grid is\nunable to meet daytime peak demand in high population areas such as Phnom Penh and experiences shortages during the\ndry season when storage in hydropower reservoirs is limited.\n12 https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/khmnc2.pdf\nii\niii\nunexploded ordinances (UXO) clearance prior to civil works.\n16. Impacts during Construction Stage: There will be temporary impacts during peak\nconstruction such as increased noise and dust levels, vibration, traffic congestion (e.g. uses of\nlocal routes for transport), waste generation, presence of workers at construction camps and\nwork sites as well as loss of vegetation, trees, plantations, orchards and/or crop damage. A\nbiodiversity assessment was carried out for the project; no habitats of significant conversation\nvalue or protected species have been identified within the project area of influence.\n17. Impacts during Operation Stage: There will be minor impacts during operation such as\nvisual impacts (industrial park in rural setting), risks to occupational and community health\nand safety, water usage for PV panel cleaning, waste generation and impacts from the site.\n18. Mitigation Measures: The identified potential adverse environmental impacts can be\nmanaged through effective implementation of the ESMP. However, the main project risks\ninclude the possible failure of the contractors to implement the environmental and social\nmonitoring plan (ESMP) effectively during construction and operation stages. These risks will\nbe mitigated by offering training and orientation on environmental and social safeguards to\nPRAC\u2019s contractors; developing and implementing site specific construction EMPs; following\nappropriate project implementation mitigation, monitoring and reporting arrangements; and\nadequate site supervision including audits of contractor\u2019s environmental health and safety\n(EHS) performance. Monitoring parameters have been identified in the ESMP to check the\neffectiveness of ESMP measures and to ensure any unidentified impacts can be readily\naddressed. The project risks will also be mitigated through inclusion of environmental\nspecifications in construction contracts, such as recycling and/or disposal of component parts\nof solar PV plants.\nInformation Disclosure, Consultation and Participation\n19. Public participation as part of this ESIA preparation for the 60MW solar plant included\ninformation disclosure via distribution of project information booklets (PIB) in affected\ncommunes during consultations, public meetings at district, and village level and focus group\ndiscussions (FGDs) with both women and men of the affected communes. All of participants\nsupported the project. Main environmental concerns expressed by the participants were\nrelated to increases in dust in the dry season, construction debris dumping during\nconstruction and the operation stage. Measures to address these concerns have been\nintegrated in the design and ESMP.\nGrievance Redress Mechanism\n20. With the oversights of NSP\u2019s PIC, PRAC will set up a project grievance redress mechanism\n(GRM) under its SECU/PMO to document and resolve complaints from affected persons. With\nthe support of SECU, Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) will be created to address concerns\nand complaints promptly via a transparent process. Complaints and their resolution will be\ndocumented and reported in project progress reports, semi-annual and annual safeguard\nreports to EDC/MoE/Lenders.\nKey ESIA and ESMP implementation Responsibilities\n21. PRAC will be responsible only for the overall supervision and coordination of the\n60MW solar plant project implementation; it will ensure consistency of all safeguards\ndocuments with government policy, legal and administrative framework across all\njurisdictions as well as assist with project GRM and meaningful consultation.\n22. PRAC\u2019s SECU will be responsible for social and environmental monitoring. With the\noversight of NSP PIC, the SECU will coordinate and interact with the PRAC\u2019s PMO on\ncompliance to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) and IFC Performance Standard\nrequirements and with relevant government agencies and local authorities on permits and\nclearances and update and finalize the ESIA and ESMP as needed.\n23. PRAC\u2019s SECU will submit monthly progress reports to PMO on Construction\nEnvironmental Management Plans (CEMP)/EMP implementation, which will inform the\nProject's progress report, semi-annual and annual safeguard monitoring reports to EDC/MoE.\n24. One annunal monitoring report (AMR) during construction and annual reports\nincluding status on the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) thereafter will be\nsubmitted Lenders for review.\nConclusion\n25. This ESIA confirmed that potential social and environmental impacts can be reduced\nto acceptable levels with effective implementation of mitigation measures. Impacts for\ninstance soil erosion due to land clearance, traffic/noise disturbance, water quality, or\nincoming workers are well identified and management measures are proposed to keep\nimpacts under control. The ESMP has specified mitigation measures to address identified\nimpacts, responsible parties, and monitoring during construction and operation. The Project\nis expected to improve electricity supply and increase access to clean and reliable energy that\nwill encourage additional investment and economic growth. A transition to cleaner energy\nsources will avoid thermal generation and imports as well as the construction of new coal-\nfired plants. This would have significant environmental benefits, contributing to national\nemission reduction targets and reduced pollution impacts.\niv\n1\nCHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Project Scope and Location\n26. Within the planned National Solar Park (NSP), PRAC Alternative (Cambodia) Company\nLimited (PRAC) will construct a 60-megawatt (MW) capacity solar plant and connect to the Phnom\nPenh demand center to supply power to the national grid13. The project is located in Kbal Toeuk\ncommune, Toeuk Phos district, Kampong Chhnang province and covers an area of 97ha. Electricit\u0117\ndu Cambodge (EDC), with ADB support, is developing the NSP facility in Kampong Chhnang Province\napproximately 60 kilometers from Phnom Penh. The NSP will accommodate up to 100 MW of solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) power generation capacity.14 The NSP\u2019s shared facilities includes the access road\nfrom National road No. 1 to the EDC susbation within the NSP, EDC substation, and 230 kV\ntransmission lines (40 km) in length from the EDC substation to the Grid 6 (GS6) substation (existing\nfacility) in Phnom Penh. PRAC was selected by EDC for the design, construction and operation of the\nfirst 60 MW of power plant within the NSP. The PRAC's 60 MW solar plant will supply electricity to\nthe grid through NSP\u2019s on-site connection to facilities designed and built by EDC.\n1.2 Lenders and Domestic Environmental Requirements\n27. IFC PS 2012 and Domestic Requirements \u2013 IFC PS 2012 sets out the environmental and social\nrequirements that apply to all IFC-financed projects. The due diligence was carried out during project\npreparation and confirms that the project requires a Social and Environmental Impact Assessment\n(ESIA) and Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). Additionally, as per the\nrequirements of the national Ministry of Environment (MOE), full ESIA is required for the solar plant.\n1.3 Structure of this Report\n28. This ESIA report follows the format prescribed in IFC PS 2012 and ADB. The other 40MW will\nbe subjected for further assessment For the purposes of this project, this ESIA contains the following:\n\u00a7 Chapter 1 \u2013 Introduction\n\u00a7 Chapter 2 \u2013 Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework\n\u00a7 Chapter 3 \u2013 Description of the Project\n\u00a7 Chapter 4 \u2013 Description of the Baseline Environment\n\u00a7 Chapter 5 \u2013 Public Consultation and Participation\n\u00a7 Chapter 6 \u2013 Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures (including\ncumulative impact assessment and mitigation management)\n\u00a7 Chapter 7 \u2013 Environmental and Social Management Plan\n\u00a7 Chapter 8 \u2013 Conclusions and Recommendations\n29.

Manila\n14 See https://www.adb.org/projects/51182-001/main for sovereign project documentation.\nCHAPTER 2: POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK\n2.1 Lenders Environmental Assessment Requirements\n2.1.1 ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS 2009)\n30. Safeguard requirements for all projects funded by ADB are defined in SPS 2009 which\nestablishes an environmental review process to ensure that projects undertaken as part of\nprograms funded through ADB loans are environmentally sound, are designed to operate in\ncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements and are not likely to cause significant\nenvironmental, health, or safety hazards. The SPS 2009 is underpinned by the ADB Operations\nManual, Bank Policy (OM Section F1/BP, October 2013). The policy also promotes adoption of\ninternational good practices as reflected in the IFC\u2019s (World Bank Group) Environmental\nHealth and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. This ESIA and EMP are intended to meet SPS 2009\nrequirements.\n31. SPS 2009 environmental assessment requirements specify that:\n\u2022 At an early stage of project preparation, the borrower/client will identify potential\ndirect, indirect, cumulative, and induced environmental impacts on and risks to\nphysical, biological, socioeconomic and cultural resources and determine their\nsignificance and scope, in consultation with stakeholders, including affected\npersons and concerned non-government organizations (NGOs). If potentially\nadverse environmental impacts and risks are identified, the borrower/client will\nundertake an environmental assessment as early as possible in the project cycle.\n\u2022 The assessment process will be based on current information, including an\naccurate project description and appropriate environmental and social baseline\ndata.\n\u2022 Impacts and risks will be analyzed in the context of the project\u2019s area of influence.\n\u2022 Environmental impacts and risks will be analyzed for all relevant stages of the\nproject cycle, including preconstruction, construction, operations,\ndecommissioning, and post-closure activities such as rehabilitation or restoration.\n\u2022 The assessment will identify potential transboundary effects as well as global\nimpacts.\n\u2022 Assessment encompasses associated facilities that are not funded as part of the\nproject (funding may be provided separately by the borrower or by third parties),\nand whose viability and existence depend exclusively on the project and whose\ngoods or services are essential for successful operation of the project.\n\u2022 Assessment encompasses existing facilities and/or business activities that already\nexist (for which) the borrower will undertake an environment and/or social\ncompliance audit, including on-site assessment to identify past or present\nconcerns related to impacts on the environment, involuntary assessment and\nindigenous peoples. The objective of the audit is to determine if actions were in\naccordance with SPS and to identify and address outstanding compliance issues.\n32. ADB adopts a set of specific safeguard requirements that Borrowers or Clients are\nrequired to meet in addressing environmental and social risks during the project preparation\n2\n3\nand implementation. These safeguard requirements include15:\n\u2022 Safeguard Requirements 1: Environment\n\u2022 Safeguard Requirements 2: Involuntary Resettlement\n\u2022 Safeguard Requirements 3: Indigenous Peoples\n\u2022 Safeguard Requirements 4: Special Requirements for Different Finance Modalities\n33. Other requirements of SPS 2009 included in the ESIA include:\n\u2022 Analysis of Alternatives. There is a requirement to examine alternatives to the\nproject\u2019s location, design, technology, components, and their potential\nenvironmental and social impacts and consider the no project alternative. SPS\n2009 states that this is only for projects which have \u2018\u2019significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts that are irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented\u2019\u2019 i.e.,\ncategory A projects. This does not apply to this category B projects but is included\nfor completion.\n\u2022 Consultation and participation. The borrower/client will carry out meaningful\nconsultation with affected persons and other concerned stakeholders, including\ncivil society and facilitate their informed participation. This ESIA includes a\nStakeholder Analysis and Communication Strategy and a consultation plan to\nensure that the project affected persons, other concerned stakeholders and the\ncivil society can provide meaningful consultations into the project detailed design\nand implementation.\n\u2022 Information disclosure. Environmental information on the project will be\ntranslated into Khmer and made available in accessible locations (e.g. project\nconstruction field offices, commune councils local government offices, etc.) in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011) and SPS (2009). The\nESIA will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s project website (www.adb.org) prior to Board\napproval, the final ESIA after detailed engineering design and safeguards\nmonitoring reports during implementation.\n\u2022 Grievance redress mechanism. The borrower/client will establish a mechanism to\nreceive and facilitate resolution of project affected persons\u2019 concerns, complaints,\nand grievances about the project\u2019s environmental (and social) performance.\n\u2022 Monitoring and Reporting. The borrower/client will monitor, measure the\nprogress of implementation of the EMP, EMOP and safeguards tender\nrequirements for IPPs and report as mandated by the SPS 2009.\n2.1.2 IFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (2012)\n34. Performance Standard requirements for all projects funded by IFC are defined in IFC's\nPerformance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (2012) which establishes\nan environmental review process to ensure that projects undertaken as part of programs\nfunded through IFC loans are environmentally sound, are designed to operate in compliance\nwith applicable regulatory requirements and are not likely to cause significant environmental,\nhealth, or safety hazards. The IFC's PS 2012 is underpinned by the IFC's Policies and Standards.\nThe policy also promotes adoption of international good practices as reflected in the IFC\u2019s\n15 ADB (2009). Safeguard Policies Statement, 2009. Asian Development Bank. Manila. The Philippines\n(World Bank Group) Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. This ESIA and ESMP\nare intended to meet IFC's PS 2012 requirements.\n35. The IFC's Environmental and Social Performance Standards in 2012 define IFC clients'\nresponsibilities for managing their environmental and social risks. The 2012 edition of IFC's\nSustainability Framework, which includes the Performance Standards, applies to all\ninvestment and advisory clients whose projects go through IFC's initial credit review process\nafter January 1, 2012.\n36. The Sustainability Framework comprises IFC's Policy and Performance Standards on\nEnvironmental and Social Sustainability and IFC's Access to Information Policy. These policies\ndescribe IFC's commitments, roles, and responsibilities related to environmental and social\nsustainability. IFC's Access to Information Policy reflects IFC's commitment to transparency\nand good governance on its operations, and outlines the Corporation's Institutional Disclosure\nobligations regarding its investment and advisory services.\n37. The Performance Standards are directed to towards clients, providing guidance on\nhow to identify risks and impacts, and are designed to help avoid, mitigate, and manage risks\nand impacts as a way of doing business in a sustainable way, including stakeholder\nengagement and disclosure obligations of the client in relation to project-level activities.\n38. In case of its direct investments (including project and corporate finance provided\nthrough financial intermediaries), IFC requires its clients to apply the Performance Standards\nto manage environmental and social risks and impacts so that development opportunities are\nenhanced. IFC uses the Sustainability Framework along with other strategies, policies, and\ninitiatives to direct the business activities of the Corporation in order to achieve its overall\ndevelopment objectives.\n39. IFC's clients are to comply with the eight Performance Standards throughout the life\nof the investment.\n\u00a7 Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social\nRisks and Impacts\n\u00a7 Performance Standard 2: Labor and Working Conditions\n\u00a7 Performance Standard 3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention\n\u00a7 Performance Standard 4: Community Health, Safety, and Security\n\u00a7 Performance Standard 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement\n\u00a7 Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Development of\nLiving Natural Resources\n\u00a7 Performance Standard 7: Indigenous Peoples\n\u00a7 Performance Standard 8: Cultural Heritage\n40. Performance Standard 1 applies to all projects that have environmental and social risks\nand impacts. Depending on project circumstances, other Performance Standards may apply\nas well. Performance Standard 1 establishes the importance of (i) integrated assessment to\nidentify the environmental and social impacts, risks, and opportunities of projects; (ii)\neffective community engagement through disclosure of project-related information and\nconsultation with local communities on matters that directly affect them; and (iii) the clients'\n4\n5\nmanagement of environmental and social performance throughout the life of the project.\n41. Performance Standards 2 through 8 establish objectives and requirements to avoid,\nminimize, and where residual impacts remain, to compensate/offset for risks and impacts to\nworkers, affected communities, and the environment. While all relevant environmental and\nsocial risks and potential impacts should be considered as part of the assessment,\nPerformance Standards 2 through 8 describe potential environmental and social risks and\nimpacts that require particular attention. Where environmental and social risks and impacts\nare identified, the client is required to manage them through its Environmental and Social\nManagement System (ESMS) consistent with Performance Standard 1.\n42. The Performance Standards should be read together and cross-referenced as needed.\nThe requirements section of each Performance Standard applies to all activities financed\nunder the project, unless otherwise noted in the specific limitations described in each\nparagraph. Clients are encouraged to apply ESMS developed under Performance Standard 1\nto all their project activities, regardless of financing sources.\n43. This ESIA/ESMP cover 60MW solar plant within the 97 ha immediate area. Other\nshared facilities including EDC's substation, transmission line, access road, and the GS6\nsubstation are NOT covered by this impact assessment.\n2.1.3 The World Bank Group General Environment, Health and Safety Guideline (EHS)\n(2007)\n44. The EHS Guidelines16 contain the performance levels and measures that are generally\nconsidered to be achievable in new facilities byexisting technology at reasonable costs.\nApplication of the EHS Guidelines to existing facilities may involve the establishment of site-\nspecific targets, with an appropriate timetable for achieving them. The applicability of the EHS\nGuidelines should be tailored to the hazards and risks established for each project on the basis\nof the results of an environmental assessment in which site-specific variables, such as host\ncountry context, assimilative capacity of the environment, and other project factors, are taken\ninto account.\n45. The Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines are technical reference\ndocuments with general and industry-specific examples of Good International Industry\nPractice (GIIP). When one or more members of the World Bank Group are involved in a project,\nthese EHS Guidelines are applied as required by their respective policies and standards.\n46. This EHS contains key guidelines on (1) Environment, (2) Occupational Health and\nSafety, (3) Community Health and Safety, and (4) Construction and Decommissioning.\n47. Performance Standard 2012 requires that during the design, construction, and\noperation of the project, the Borrower/Client will apply pollution prevention and control\ntechnologies and practices consistent with International Best Practice, as reflected in\ninternationally recognized standards of the International Finance Corporation\u2019s (World Bank\nGroup) Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (\u201cEHS Guidelines\u201d) and World Health\nOrganization (WHO). These standards contain performance levels and measures that are\n16 WGB General EHS Guidelines (2007) https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/29f5137d-6e17-4660-b1f9-\n02bf561935e5/Final%2B-%2BGeneral%2BEHS%2BGuidelines.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=jOWim3p\nnormally acceptable and applicable to projects. When host country regulations differ from\nthese levels and measures, the Borrower/Client will achieve whichever is more stringent. If\nless stringent levels or measures are appropriate in view of specific project circumstances, the\nBorrower/Client will provide full and detailed justification for any proposed alternatives that\nare consistent with the requirements presented in this document. These EHS Guidelines are\nadopted in the ESMP for the project such as IFC (WBG) Industry Sector EHS Guidelines for\nElectric Power Transmission and Distribution (2007)17; and Environmental Guidelines on Air\nEmissions and Ambient Air Quality, Noise Management, Wastewater and Ambient Water\nQuality, Hazardous Material Management and Waste Management as well as Occupational\nHealth and Safety and Community Health and Safety (2007).\n2.1.4 ADB Climate Change Commitments\n48. In 2015, ADB committed itself to increasing climate financing from its own resources\nto $6 billion yearly by 2020\u2014$4 billion for mitigation in sectors such as renewable energy,\nenergy efficiency, sustainable transport, and urban development, and $2 billion for adaptation\nin areas such as urban resilience and agriculture and land use. The $6 billion target\ncorresponds to around 30% of ADB\u2019s projected corporate pipeline by 2020. In 2017, ADB\nreached a record high of $4.5 billion in climate investments, a 21% increase from the $3.7\nbillion reached in 2016. From 2011 to 2017, ADB approved more than $25 billion for climate\nfinancing\u2014$21.7 billion from ADB\u2019s own resources while leveraging over $3.4 billion from\nexternal resources.\n49. With a view to deliver stronger, better, and faster support to its Developing Member\nCountries (DMCs), ADB has established its Climate Change Operational Framework, 2017\u2013\n2030 (CCOF 2030), which positions ADB to facilitate, collaboratively and proactively, a regional\nshift toward a low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development path. It further provides\na framework for supporting DMCs in translating their nationally determined contribution\n(NDC) aspirations into climate change action investment plans and implementing those plans.\n2.2 JICA Guidelines for Environmental and Social Considerations (2010)\n50. JICA, which is responsible for Japan\u2019s ODA, plays a key role in contributing to\nsustainable development in developing countries. The inclusion of environmental and social\ncosts in development costs and the social and institutional framework that makes such\ninclusion possible are crucial for sustainable development. Internalization and an institutional\nframework are requirements for measures regarding environmental and social considerations,\nand JICA is required to have suitable consideration for environmental and social impacts.\n51. The objectives of the guidelines are to encourage Project proponents etc. to have\nappropriate consideration for environmental and social impacts, as well as to ensure that\nJICA\u2019s support for and examination of environmental and social considerations are conducted\naccordingly. The guidelines outline JICA\u2019s responsibilities and procedures, along with its\nrequirements for project proponents etc., in order to facilitate the achievement of these\nobjectives.\n52. JICA recognizes the following seven principles to be very important.\n17 IFC (WBG) Industry Sector Guidelines for Electric Power Transmission and Distribution\n6\n7\na. A wide range of impacts must be addressed.\nb. Measures for environmental and social considerations must be implemented from\nan early stage to a monitoring stage.\nc. JICA is responsible for accountability when implementing cooperation projects.\nd. JICA asks stakeholders for their participation.\ne. JICA discloses information.\nf. JICA enhances organizational capacity.\ng. JICA makes serious attempts at promptness.\n53. For project categorization, JICA classifies projects into four categories according to the\nextent of environmental and social impacts, taking into account an outline of project, scale,\nsite condition, etc.\na. Category A: Proposed projects are classified as Category A if they are likely to have\nsignificant adverse impacts on the environment and society. Projects with\ncomplicated or unprecedented impacts that are difficult to assess, or projects with\na wide range of impacts or irreversible impacts, are also classified as Category A.\nThese impacts may affect an area broader than the sites or facilities subject to\nphysical construction. Category A, in principle, includes projects in sensitive\nsectors, projects that have characteristics that are liable to cause adverse\nenvironmental impacts, and projects located in or near sensitive areas.\nb. Category B: Proposed projects are classified as Category B if their potential\nadverse impacts on the environment and society are less adverse than those of\nCategory A projects. Generally, they are site-specific; few if any are irreversible;\nand in most cases, normal mitigation measures can be designed more readily.\nc. Category C: Proposed projects are classified as Category C if they are likely to have\nminimal or little adverse impact on the environment and society.\nd. Category FI: Proposed projects are classified as Category FI if they satisfy all of the\nfollowing requirements: JICA\u2019s funding of projects is provided to a financial\nintermediary or executing agency; the selection and appraisal of the sub-projects\nis substantially undertaken by such an institution only after JICA\u2019s approval of the\nfunding, so that the sub-projects cannot be specified prior to JICA\u2019s approval of\nfunding (or project appraisal); and those sub-projects are expected to have a\npotential impact on the environment.\n54. For impact assessment, the impacts to be assessed with regard to environmental and\nsocial considerations include impacts on human health and safety, as well as on the natural\nenvironment, that are transmitted through air, water, soil, waste, accidents, water usage,\nclimate change, ecosystems, fauna and flora, including trans-boundary or global scale impacts.\nThese also include social impacts, including migration of population and involuntary\nresettlement, local economy such as employment and livelihood, utilization of land and local\nresources, social institutions such as social capital and local decision-making institutions,\nexisting social infrastructures and services, vulnerable social groups such as poor and\nindigenous peoples, equality of benefits and losses and equality in the development process,\ngender, children\u2019s rights, cultural heritage, local conflicts of interest, infectious diseases such\nas HIV/AIDS, and working conditions including occupational safety. Items to be addressed in\nthe specific project are narrowed down to the needed ones through the scoping process.\n55. In addition to the direct and immediate impacts of projects, the derivative, secondary,\nand cumulative impacts as well as impacts associated with indivisible projects will also be\nassessed with regard to environmental and social considerations, so far as it is rational. The\nlife cycle impact of a project period is also considered.\n2.3 Cambodian EIA requirements\n56. The following regulations and guidelines manage and require environmental impact\nassessment in Cambodia:\n\u00a7 Law on Natural Resource Management and Environmental Protection (1996) highlights\nthe requirement for environmental impact assessment for both state and private\nprojects (Article 6 & 7, Chapter 3).\n\u00a7 Sub-decree on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process No. 72 (1999) provides\nthe detailed guidelines for implementation of the EIA process and specifically that\npower plants that generate more than 5 MW require an IEIA or EIA.\n\u00a7 Declaration on Guideline for Conducting IEIA and EIA Reports No. 376 (2009) specifies\nthe basic contents of IEIA/EIA Reports, which should include: (i) introduction, (ii) legal\nframework, (iii) project description, (iv) description of the existing environment, (v)\npublic participation, (vi) assessment of and mitigation measures for significant\nenvironmental impacts, (vii) environmental management plan, (viii) cost-benefit\nanalysis, and (ix) conclusion and recommendations.\n57. The MoE through its EIA Department regulates and monitors the EIA process. The MOE\nis responsible for: (i) review and approval of IEIA/EIA reports in collaboration with other\nrelevant ministries and (ii) monitoring the ESMP implementation of Project\nProponents/Owners throughout the different project stages. The MOE operates at the\nmunicipal and provincial levels through its Provincial Departments of Environment (PDOE).\n58. The Project Proponents/Owner (public or private) is required to submit the necessary\nproject document (IEIA/EIA Reports) to the MOE for review and approval. After submission of\nIEIA/EIA report, it will take a maximum of 30 working days for a decision.\n59. The MoE's Prokas on Classifying Development Projects for ESIA in 2018 has indicated\nthat any power project producing more that 10MW required ESIA for MoE to review and\napprove prior to any construction and operation. Therefore, ESIA is required for the 97-ha\nSolar Plant Project and Terms of Reference (ToR) was submitted and approved in September\n2020.\n2.3.1 National Environmental Legislations\n60. The Environment Law has the following objectives:\n\u00a7 Protect and upgrade environmental quality and reduce pollution\n\u00a7 Assess the impacts of proposed projects before approval\n\u00a7 Ensure rational and sustainable use of the Kingdom\u2019s resources\n\u00a7 Encourage public participation in environmental protection and natural resource\nmanagement\n\u00a7 Reduce activities that impact negatively on the environment\n8\n9\n61. Specific regulations and standards for environmental quality are contained in three\nSub-decrees:\n\u00a7 Sub-decree on Solid Waste Management (1999)\n\u00a7 Sub-decree on Water Pollution Control (2009)\n\u00a7 Sub-decree on Air Pollution Control and Noise Disturbance (2000)\n62.

Cambodia Climate Change Commitments. The First and Second National\nCommunication was submitted to UNFCCC in October 200224 and November 201525,\nrespectively. The Second National Communication contained information on the country\u2019s\nmajor source of GHG emissions and sinks, vulnerability, adaptation options and mitigation\nmeasures that Cambodia has implemented or intends to implement to further contribute to\nglobal efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Furthermore, Cambodia\u2019s Nationally Determined\nContribution (NDC) enshrined in the 2016 Paris Agreement26, commits to a 16% reduction in\nGHG emissions from a business as usual scenario by 2030 from the energy sector.27 The\nNational Strategic Development Plan (2014-2018) states the importance of implementing\nCambodia\u2019s Climate Change Strategic Plan (2014-2023) and contains indicators to track\nimplementation of climate change actions. In alignment to the Climate Change Strategic Plan\nof Cambodia, Sectoral Climate Change Strategic Plans and Action Plans have also been\ndeveloped.\n65. Regional Agreements. At the regional level, Cambodia has ratified the following\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreements: (i) on Trans-boundary Haze\nPollution in 2006; and (ii) on Disaster Management and Emergency Response, entered into\nforce in 2009.\n66. Sub-Regional Agreements. At the sub-regional level, Cambodia, along with the Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand and Viet Nam, signed the \u201cAgreement on the\nCooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin\u201d (or the Mekong\nAgreement) in April 1995.\n24 https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/khmnc1.pdf (accessed May 2018)\n25 https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/khmnc2.pdf (accessed May 2018)\n26 The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016.\n27 Government of Cambodia. 2015. Cambodia\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution. Phnom Penh.\n14\n15\nCHAPTER 3: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT\n3.1 Rationale\n67. Country Background. Cambodia\u2019s economy has grown quickly over the past decade,\naveraging annual growth of 7.0% from 2006 to 2016 and poverty has fallen substantially, from\n47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2014.28 Nonetheless, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita,\nestimated at $1,427 in 2017, remains among the lowest in Asia. An underdeveloped energy\nsector is a key constraint to the further improvement of Cambodia\u2019s economic\ncompetitiveness and the welfare of its people. Cambodia\u2019s energy sector is faced with several\nstrategic challenges. Access to reliable energy is the most pressing one in the short and\nmedium term while broader and longer-term issues of energy security, affordability and\nenvironmental sustainability also need to be addressed. Nearly 5 million Cambodians do not\nhave access to electricity and are reliant on batteries, wood and other traditional fuels for\nenergy. Historically, the high cost of power, dependence on conventional energy sources and\nlimited transmission and distribution networks, coupled with intermittent power supply, have\nhindered economic competitiveness and discouraged private sector investments. Annual\nelectricity demand growth in Cambodia averaged 16% from 2011 to 2017. In 2017,\nCambodia's energy consumption was 8,073 gigawatt-hour (GWh), of which 44% was coal, 34%\nhydro, 4% diesel, less than 1% renewables and 18% power imports from neighboring countries.\nThe hydropower and coal-fired plants are owned by the private sector and operated under\nlong-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with take-or-pay arrangements. The current\nPower Development Plan (PDP), revised in 2015, projects demand growth to average about 7%\nthrough 2030.\n68. The government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy, Phase IV (2018\u20132023), highlights increased\ninvestment in solar energy to reduce electricity costs and ensure long-term energy security.29\nThe government also prioritized the development of renewable energy in its National\nStrategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018 to meet growing demand for electricity in Phnom\nPenh and address the country\u2019s electrification target of 100% of villages by 2020.30 In addition,\nthe Government\u2019s Industrial Development Policy 2015\u2013202531 identifies the historically high\npower tariffs in the country as a major impediment to the competitiveness of the country\u2019s\nmanufacturing sector and calls for alternate sources of energy to be developed. Furthermore,\nCambodia\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution, enshrined in the 2016 Paris Agreement32\ncommits to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions from a business as usual scenario by 2030 from\nthe energy sector.33 Ideally, alternate, clean sources of energy would complement installed\nand planned hydropower-based generation, which is often inadequate during the dry season\nas well as help provide ancillary benefits to the grid around the key demand centers.\n28ADB. 2016.

PRAC will construct a 60 MW capacity solar plant in Kampong Chhnang province and\nconnect to the EDC substation within the NSP. EDC will construct the 40 km 230 kV overhead\ntransmission line from the common substation within the NSP to the existing GS6 substation\nlocated in Odong district in Kampong Speu province34.\n70. The NSP project is the first of its kind in Cambodia and builds on lessons learnt from\nADB Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s financing of a 10 MW solar PV plant at Bavet,\nSvay Rieng province in 2016. The NSP project aims to demonstrate the ability of large-scale\nsolar parks to produce solar energy at a competitive price while also providing technical\nbenefits to the national grid and substitute for planned fossil fuel and hydropower generation\nin the future 35. This NSP project will build appreciation for the costs, operational requirements\nand actual performance of solar PV plants.\n3.2 National Solar Park Project Structure\n71. The National Solar Park project combines the five components under the oversight of\nEDC. According to the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), PRAC\u2019s responsibility is to develop,\nconstruct and operate the 60 MW solar plant (phase 1) whereas EDC will provide the NSP\nshared facilities. These shared facilities include:\n1. Access road: EDC is designing and selecting the aliganment for the access road. Once\ncompleted, this road will be the shared facility for NSP. The identified road will be\nupgraded and constructed in order to ensure that the mobilization of heavy equipment\nand manpower to be used for construction and operation phase.\n2. EDC substation: 22kV/115 kV substation to be located on 5 ha inside the total 102 ha\narea of NSP phase 1.

All of the sites are\nlocated between Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu provinces. Out of the three preferred\nsites, two were dropped from further study mainly due to potential socio-economic impacts\nand ease and cost of land acquisition. For details refer to Section 3.9, Chapter 3 of this ESIA.\nEDC further determined that the optimal point of connection of the proposed solar park site\n(initially referred to as site 6) to the national grid is at GS6. GS6 is located close to the major\nload center of Phnom Penh. Connecting the new NSP substation at the solar park site to GS6\nwill minimize the need for EDC to build new infrastructure, provide voltage support and\nreduce network losses.\n79. One natural stream (i.e. Preak Mkak) to the west of the 60 MW solar plant will be\nconserved. The small creek running through the plant site (land that is privately owned) will\nbe modified as an internal drainage. The proposed 60 MW solar plant is also situated outside\nthe historical flood zone. Detailed engineering design of the 60 MW solar plant integrates\nmeasures based on recommendations from the hydrological study to maximize flood\nresilience and minimize impacts on local drainage patterns. Details on hydrology and flood\nrisks are provided in Chapter 4 of this ESIA.\n80. Common infrastructure within the 60 MW solar plant includes perimeter fencing with\nadequate ground clearance (for passage of animals/wild species), drainage design and/or\nbuilding storm water retention pond. There is an existing paved road up to the start of the 60\nMW solar plant (width 30 m) was built by the local Army; this approach road connects Road\nNo. 132/52.\n81. Shared access roads to the site (length 3-4 km, width 5.5 m) will be constructed and\nmaintained for transportation of the equipment, materials and machinery and further\nmaintained during operation of the NSP by EDC.\n3.5.2 Project basic layout and 60 MW solar plant design\n(A) Project system summary as of October 2020\n82. Conceptually, the solar plant is planned to be equipped with 535 Watt-peak\nmonocrystalline bifacial photovoltaic modules (PV module) for the generation of electricity\nfrom sunlight. The total DC installed capacity is envisaged to be 78 MW-peak comprising of\n164,248 PV modules. The PV modules will be installed on the East-West single-axis tracking\nsystem which mounted on foundation which designed accordingly to the geotechnical\nproperties of the project\u2019s land, taking into account the loads from PV modules, mounting\nstructures and wind loads. The plant is composed of (i) 20 subsystems, each subsystem has a\n3150k VA Box \u2013 Transformer; (ii) 175kW string inverter total 343 sets; (iii) 475Wp\nmonocrystallin photovoltaic module, the PV module size is 2119 x 1038 x 35MM. The plant\nwill use a total number of PV modules is 164,248 PCS, and the total capacity of 78.0178Wp.\nTotal 3 weather stations will be constructed.\n83. The PV modules will be connected to increase it voltage and form PV strings which will\nbe connected to 175 kW String inverter in order to convert direct current electricity generated\nfrom solar power to alternate current electricity. The output from each string inverter is then\nconnected to the box transformer station in order to increase its output voltage from low\nvoltage to medium voltage at 22 kV for the distribution to the Interconnection point. The box\ntransformer comprises of low voltage input collection part, 22 kV step-up transformer and 22\nkV switchgear. There will be 20 box transformer installed to collect output from the string\ninverter installed at the different part of the project lands. The output from each of the box\ntransformer will be connected to each other, forming a 22 kV ring main system. The four (4)\noutput of 22 kV ring main system (each comprising 20 MW output) will be connected to the\nInterconnection point at EDC\u2019s substation via underground cable (from the nearest box\ntransformer to the Interconnection point). The Interconnection Point is at four (4) of 22 kV\nincoming feeders of EDC substation. The revenue meter also installed at the Interconnection\nPoint. This is the end of PRAC\u2019s scope of work as IPP.\n84. Weather stations to be installed on-site are important for the verification of system\nperformance during commissioning, testing and also during the operational period. In\naddition, weather data such as wind speed is also crucial for the safe operation of single-axis\ntracking as well. The sensors to be installed at the solar plant includes pyranometers to\nmeasure solar resource on front and rear side of PV module, temperature sensors to measure\nambient and PV module temperature, wind speed, rainfall and humidity sensors.\n85. Lighting Protection System. This project will use Early Stream Emission (ESE) system\nto prevent the damages due to lighting strike. Considering the maximum elevation of PV\nmodule is 3 meters, the ESE for the PV installation area which lighting rod is designed to be 8\nmeters height which will cover radius of 89 meters. The 50 lightning rods will be installed in\nthe PV installation area. The Lighting Protection System (LPS) will also be provided for the\nmain components of the solar plant. All metal parts of the solar plant equipment shall be\nearthed to provide equipotential bonding, Surge Protection Device (SPD) will be installed in\nthe important circuit of the electrical equipment.\n86. String inverter. String inverters are installed near to the solar module support structure.\nMetal shell will be connected to the earthing grid via grounding cable. The inverter forms an\nequipotential object with the earthing system. Consider the inverter as the major power\ngeneration device, every circuit of the DC and AC side has installed one SPD to protection\ninternal component from the indirect lightning damage.\n87. Box transformer. The MV transformer, 22 kV switchgear and Low Voltage LV cabinet\nare installed in one prefabricated container, and the container is provided with at least two\ngrounding points. The grounding points are reliably connected to the main earthing grid via\ngrounding cable and used for guiding lightning energy into the ground. In addition, lightning\narresters are also arranged in the 22 kV switchgear of box transformer, while the LV side is\narranged SPD to protect against the indirect lightning damage. The cooling oil type for\ntransformer is mineral oil which is PCB free.\n88. Solar module and support structure. The solar module frame is used as the natural air-\ntermination and connected to the support structure via grounding cable as the natural down-\nconductor. The support structure is connected to the main earthing grid via grounding cable\nto form a complete grounding system. Meanwhile the internal part of single axis tracker has\nbeen connected via grounding cable, including the connection between slew and post, slew\n20\n21\nand damper, control box and post, all the tracker are connected as an equipotential object,\nrefer to the following figure.\n89. The project will construct a fire path break around the project boundary to prevent\nforest fires from reaching the solar plant and other facilities. There will be equipment ready\nfor fire-fighting (e.g. water trucks with water cannons) and train personnel to respond to forest\nfires in the Project area.\n90.

The land requirements have been defined to provide the PRAC with sufficient land to\noptimize the potential plant configurations for the cheapest energy price possible. The\nfollowing plant parameters were used to define land size:\n\u2022 DC/AC ratio between nominal output power of solar modules (DC) and solar inverters\n(AC)\n\u2022 Distance between the rows and tilt (for fixed-tilt mounting systems)\n\u2022 Ground Cover Ratio (GCR) for single-axis tracked systems\n\u2022 Module wattage\n92. In consideration of the above, the area requirements have been defined. They have\nbeen conservatively determined to provide enough room to PRAC for optimizing the above\nlisted parameters.\n3.5.4 Stormwater management and drainage\n93. Soil test results are included as Appendix II.\n94. Utilizing the abovementioned studies, the 60 MW solar project will be equipped with\nthe:\n1. Flood protection system to prevent overflowing water from the stream at the\nwestern side of the 60 MW solar plant project.\n2. Internal drainage system for the internal water catchment, collection from all areas\nand conveying into the retention pond.\n3. Retention pond and discharge channel, the collected water is retained until the\nwater reach certain limit and therefore safely discharge to the external water\nchannel can be done through the discharge channel.\n95. One main drainage canal will be constructed as part of the 60 MW solar plant to\nprovide an adequate drainage system for the PV site. It will head southwards through the\ncentre of the site. The length of this canal depicted in the canal layout (see Figure L, M above).\nPRAC will construct the internal drainage system to mitigate flood hazards, using the main\ncanal for water evacuation. Retention ponds tocollect water internally inside the 60 MW solar\nplant project will be built before safe release to the discharge point which leads to the\nreservoir located south of the National Solar Park. The water collected in the retention pond\nalso can be filtered and purified for the cleaning the solar panels if it is required.\n44\n45\n3.5.5 Amenities and facilities\n96. Water consumption: During the construction stage, the main water consumption\nincludes 2 parts:\n\u2022 The water for concrete mixing and concrete curing is more or less 180L/m\u00b3, there are\nabout 3,069 m\u00b3 concrete which is planing to be used at site, so the water consumption\nis about 553m3 (i.e. 180*3,069), and the water consumption for concrete curing is\nabout 200m3. In total, there are 553 + 200 = 753m3.\n\u2022 The domestic water in the construction stage for one person is about 40L-50L/day,\nduring the peak construction stage, there are 60-100 person who are working at site\nat same time. The water consumption for one year is about 876-1,825m3.\n97. During the operation and maintenance period, the main water consumption includes\n2 parts:\n\u2022 (1) Cleaning PV panels. During the operation and maintenance period, 5m3 water is\nrequired for each MW PV panel cleaning, 390m3 is required for 78MW PV panel\ncleaning one time. There will be four times/year, which requires 1,560m3 water for\ncleaning PV panels.\n\u2022 (2) Domestic water. In the maintenance stage, domestic water for one person is about\n40L-50L/day, and the number of operation and maintenance personnel in peak period\nis about 10-15 persons, and the water consumption for one year is about 144-270m3.\nTable 4: Water consumption\nPhase Main Activity Annual Consumption Daily Consumption\nConstruction Civil work 753m3 -\nDomestic \u2013 not include 1,825 m3 5m3/day\ndrinking water (in the peak\nconstruction)\nO&M Panel cleaning 1,560 m3 390 m3/time\nDomestic \u2013 no include 270 m3 0.7 m3/day\ndrinking water\n98. Water sources: The water consumption during the construction period is\napproximately 1,629m3-2,578m3 which is more than the consumption during operation and\nO&M period. Considering a one-year construction period, the daily water consumption is\napproximately 7m3. It is proposed to source water from local water service providers around\nthe project site. Tanked water will be the main source for both construction and operation\nphases. As confirmed by the Royas village chief, there are some private water suppliers who\ncan truck water into the project site with the amounts required. The source of such tanked\nwater is from Anlong Chrey dam or reservoir (not from groundwater) where the suppliers will\nneed to get permission38 from local authorities before pumping and selling the water to the\nproject. The amount the supplier can support is 8m3 or more per day depending the\nnegotiation. The supply is sufficient for the construction which 2,920m3 can be trucked into\nthe project site, and even more sufficient for operation period. Buying such water requires\nthe PRAC to record the amount bought from supplier and report to Kampong Chhnang\n38 PRAC talked to the supplier and confirmed that the supplier would request permission/ a permit from the commune chief\nand local in-charge district office prior to pumping and selling water from Anlong Chrey dam to the project. PRAC does not\nneed to get any permit to buy the water from the supplier.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 58 ---\n| Phase | Main Activity | Annual Consumption | Daily Consumption |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Construction | Civil work | 753m3 | - |\n|  | Domestic \u2013 not include\ndrinking water (in the peak\nconstruction) | 1,825 m3 | 5m3/day |\n| O&M | Panel cleaning | 1,560 m3 | 390 m3/time |\n|  | Domestic \u2013 no include\ndrinking water | 270 m3 | 0.7 m3/day |\n\nDepartment of Water Resource and Meteorology39. In combination, stormwater will be\ncollected during wet season for reuse during the construction and maintenance periods.\nStormwater will be treated and tested prior for cleaning the PV panels. Stormwater runoff\nwill be collected by drainage system and retention ponds. There are already water\nreservoirs/ponds at site which can be reinforced and used to store water for panels cleaning.\n99. To store stormwater, the two existing ponds could carry the storage capacity of 1)\n12,759m3 (pond 1 size: 4,250m2 x 3m depth) and 2) 18,750m3 (pond 2 size: 6,250m2 x 3m\ndepth) whose quantity could serve the project needs during the dry season.

In the future, borehole and use of groundwater will be potential for the uses during\nconstruction and operation. A detailed assessment will be conducted by PRAC to confirm the\nimpacts of using it prior to any extraction and PRAC will comply with any related regulations\nfor the permit to use groundwater. However, it was confirmed from the field investigation that\nthere is no borehole located in the project site. A borehole was found at a household\nhomestead, about 2km away from the Plant site, and the water availability from this borehole\nwas sufficient for domestic uses for both wet and dry seasons. Based on Cambodian Ministry\nof Rural Development's guideline for clean water supply, a borehole is used for 25-30 rural\nhouseholds. It is estimated that each household may consume at least from 0.25-0.5m3 per\nday (i.e. each person consumes 40-50L/d) and approximately 7.5m3 per month per household.\nThe field investigation further indicated that the villagers' boreholes served year-round, but\ngroundwater was reported to be lower during the dry season, but not to the lowest that could\nnot be extracted.\n101. The extraction of groundwater for the project, rather than vital human needs (i.e.\ndrinking, washing, bathing and other domestic purposes including watering for animal\nhusbandry, fishing and the irrigation of domestic gardens and orchards) will require a license\nfrom the Ministry of Water Resource Management and Meteorology40.\n39 The Director requests that the project shall record the amount of water uses and share it with the Department for archive.\n40 Law on Water Resource Management (2007), Article 11: Every person has the right to use water resources for his/her\nvital human need including drinking, washing, bathing and other domestic purposes including watering for animal\n46\n47\n102. During operation stage, panel cleaning water will evaporate naturally after cleaning\nwhich doesn't need to be recycled.\n103. Groundwater and river water quality have been analysed to design and build water\ncatchment and treatment system necessary for providing water suitable for the module\ncleaning process.\n3.5.6 Proposed land use and preparation\n104. The break-down of the indicative land use below is calculated for a 60 MW fixed-tilt\n(with 1.2 ha/MW, 1.3 DC/AC ratio) and a 60 MW single-axis tracked system (with 2 ha/MW,\n1.3 DC/AC ratio) of non-rectangular shape. For a fixed-tilt system, the numbers are different\nas the mounting structure can be adapted more cost-efficiently to irregular shapes.41\n105. Ninety-seven hectares of land within the NSP will be leased from EDC during the entire\npower purchase agreement period. The Project\u2019s land will be utilized accordingly to below\ntable.\nTable 5: Break-down of proposed land use for a fixed-tilt system (60 MW solar plant)\nArea in hectares Area in percentage\nDescription\n(%)\nBuildings and fencing (fence and space 5 ha 5 %\nbetween boundary and plant components)\nInternal roads and parking area 3 ha 3 %\nPV plant components (22kV underground 88 ha 91 %\ncable, inverters, transformers, modules,\nmounting structures, space between tracking\ntables, PV string cable, inverter output cable,\nMV AC cable)\nDrainage systems and Retention pond 1 ha 1 %\nTotal area of 60 MW solar plant under National 97 ha 100 %\nsolar park\n106.

The fore-mentioned uses are not subject to the licensing.\nArticle 12: The diversion, abstraction and use of water resources for purposes other than those mentioned in Article 11,\nand the construction of the waterworks relating thereto, are subject to a license or permit.\nArticle 20: Any person carries out drilling or digging of the wells for the professional or commercial purposes shall supply\nthe MOWRAM with a detailed report on the drilling or digging operation, the technical specifications and other\ninformation. The utilization of the ground-waters and aquifers for the professional or commercial purposes the quantity\nof which exceed the level as defined in Article 11 shall be subject to licensing. The no-drilling or digging zones shall be\ndefined in the Government Sub Decree.\n41 The reason is that motors for tracked systems are dimensioned for specific table lengths. Adapting too many tracker tables\nto the irregular shape of the power plant area will lead to over-dimensioning of overall motor capacity installed and hence\nhigher relative costs.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 60 ---\n| Description | Area in hectares | Area in percentage\n(%) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Buildings and fencing (fence and space\nbetween boundary and plant components) | 5 ha | 5 % |\n| Internal roads and parking area | 3 ha | 3 % |\n| PV plant components (22kV underground\ncable, inverters, transformers, modules,\nmounting structures, space between tracking\ntables, PV string cable, inverter output cable,\nMV AC cable) | 88 ha | 91 % |\n| Drainage systems and Retention pond | 1 ha | 1 % |\n| Total area of 60 MW solar plant under National\nsolar park | 97 ha | 100 % |\n\n107.

Based on the IEE (2018-19) for NSP, preliminary site evaluation was based on\nassessment of seven individual sites identified by EDC42, and followed by field visits in May\nand July 2017. Site 6 was identified as the preferred site for the solar park.\n122. Some sites were excluded due to potential socio-economic impacts and ease and cost\nof land acquisition followed by other criteria such a unsuitable terrain and vulnerability to\nflooding (a key concern in Cambodia given the seasonal flood pattern). For example:\n\u00a7 Site 1 is close to a cemetery and urban areas. Land acquisition costs will be high and\nthe potential social impacts more significant than at other sites. The site is also small,\nlimiting scope for future potential expansion of the initial park (the initial 100 MW\n42National Solar Park Project for Cambodia: Pre-Feasibility Study, August 2017\n54\n55\nsolar park requires a land area of 150-250 hectares, assuming 1.5-2 hectares per 1 MW\nof installed capacity). Therefore, it was dropped from further evaluation.\n\u00a7 Site 2 is located about 10km from GS6 where the land price is also very expensive. In\naddition, EDC noted that it would make little sense to build a new substation and\ntransmission line from the site to GS-6 for such a short distance and that, if a site close\nto GS6 is to be used, it would be more economic to select Site 1 which is adjacent to\nGS6 and would avoid these infrastructure investment costs. Therefore, it was dropped\nfrom further evaluation.\n\u00a7 Site 3 is opposite a primary school and next to a reservoir. It is located along national\nroad 44, about 35-40km from GS6 (straight line distance) where the land price is\nconsidered medium to high. The site size of 205 hectares may also be too small and\nconstrain possible future expansion of the solar park. The land may be suitable for an\nagro-plantation and land preparation appears to already have taken place on parts of\nan Economic Land Concession (ELC) within the site, which will further raise the cost\nand complexity of land acquisition. Therefore, it was dropped from further evaluation.\n\u00a7 Sites 4, 5 and 7 are mostly occupied by scrubland with scattered grown trees and palm\ntrees. Land values are assessed as being much lower than for Sites 1, 2 and 3. The\nnumber of landowners with land-based livelihoods is also expected to be low,\nminimizing social impacts. However, EDC recommended dropping site 4 while further\npreliminary technical and socio-economic assessment43 resulted in dropping site 7\nfrom evaluation and keeping site 5 as back up.\n3.9.2 Technology Selection\n123. PV Module Technologies: A number of PV module technologies were assessed for use\nin the project, and selection was based on minimum environmental impacts and disposal\nmethod and procedures as follows:\n\u00a7 Crystalline Modules: Most manufacturers of crystalline modules have a performance\nguarantee of 25 years however; these panels can have a longer lifetime if maintained\nproperly. Crystalline modules pose little to no risk to the environment in terms of\ntoxicity since most of the module is made of common construction materials such as\ntempered glass and aluminum. Furthermore, the PV cell is made from silicon, which is\na common earth element. Some panels contain a small amount of lead however; it is\nsealed in a panel to reduce the risk of environmental release44. Even though these\nmodules do not pose a significant environmental risk, they should be recycled. PV\nCycle is an organization of PV module manufacturers that collects and recycles PV\nmodules within the EU with the costs of these services included in the selling price of\nthe modules45. In 2016, PV Cycle extended its collection and recycling service to\ninclude Japan46. The waste management solution is also offered to other countries\noutside of the EU however; an additional fee may be required for services. Recycle\nSolar is another option for PV recycling. The company recycles damaged or defect PV\n43Inception Report, February 2018\n44 NC Clean Energy Technology Center (n.d.). Health and Safety Impacts of Solar Photo-Voltaics\n45 http://www.pvcycle.org/services/european-union/\n46 http://www.pvcycle.org/press/pv-cycle-launches-take-back-and-recycling-service-in-japan/\nmodules of all types in the UK and Ireland47.\n\u00a7 CdTe Thin Film Modules: CdTe modules also have a warranty of 25 years.48 The\nmodules contain small amounts of cadmium, which is a toxic heavy metal. Tests have\nshown that in the event that these panels are damaged, only a negligible amount will\nbe leached from the panel. Also, in the event of a catastrophic event such as a fire, the\nrelease of cadmium is below human health evaluation levels.49 Recycling of CdTe\nmodules is the best option after decommissioning due to the potential release of\ncadmium into the environment. First Solar, a leading CdTe module manufacturer, has\na take-back policy to pay for collecting and recycling modules at the end of their life\ncycle.50\n\u00a7 CIGS Thin Film Modules: CIGS modules typically have a shorter lifetime than other PV\nmodule technologies. These cells consist of copper, indium, gallium and selenium,\nwhich are all not considered to be very toxic elements. However, the potential\nformation of hydrogen selenide from selenium is a concern because it is a carcinogen.\nAlso, some cells contain a thin layer of cadmium, which is toxic to the environment.\nThe release of these compounds into the environment is not a significant risk when\nthe panels are in normal use however; special disposal is required at the end of the\nproduct life. For recycling, CIGS modules can be collected through programs such as\nPV Cycle.\n124. For the purpose of this 60 MW solar plant project, bifacial monocrystalline modules\nwill be utilized in the solar PV plants. For end of life/failure or at decommissioning, provision\nin tender agreements with suppliers/vendors will ensure proper and safe collection, recycling\nand/or disposal, as needed.\n125.

World Bank/IFC51 and the ADB SPS requires baseline data to be collected for the ESIA\nwhich includes relevant physical, biological, and socio-economic conditions; which are like\nwhat is stated in the 2009 IEIA/EIA preparation guideline by Cambodian MOE. The Cambodian\nguidelines mention that a Full ESIA shall describe physical -resources, biological environment\nand socio-economic resources, based on both primary and secondary data available within\nand around project area to determine, predict and analyze possible environmental and social\nimpacts caused by project activities in order to take measures to minimize negative impacts\nand maximize positive impacts. The scope of the study is defined as follow:\n127. Spatial: The study covers a total land area of 97ha. The study will cover areas outside\nthe project boundary, but not farther than 3 km radius from the palnt site. Certain issues like\nwildlife migration, water quality, and impacts on health at downstream village and natural\nresource-based livelihood will be assessed.\n128. Temporal: The ESIA report is prepared to cover different phases of the project, which\ninclude: (i) design phase and preparation/construction phases, (ii) operation phase, and (iii)\ndecommissioning phase. Baseline information was collected only one time; however, existing\navailable data and information, especially from the project proponent (any relevant studies\nconducted for the NSP), were collected and documented in the report.\n4.2 Geographical Location\n129. Overall, EDC has already aquired the 97 ha for the 60MW solar plant and all land titles\nhave been being coverted into one-single tenure and will be expected to complete prior to\nMarch 2021 (see Figure 3 below).\n130. The proposed project site is geographically situated between 11.669518\u00b0 and\n11.804790\u00b0 north latitudes and 104.334288\u00b0 and 104.699287\u00b0 east longitudes in the\nprovinces of Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu in Cambodia, located northwest and west\nof capital Phnom Penh, respectively. The north border of Kampong Chhnang lies on the banks\nof the Tonle Sap Lake. Kampong Chhnang province is connected to the capital by National\nRoad No. 5 at a distance of 91 km. Kampong Chhnang province has a population of over\n504,234 persons and a population density of 86 persons per square km. The project is located\nonly in Tuek Phos district in Kampong Chhnang province and closely to Thpong and Odongk\ndistricts in Kampong Speu province. There is only one project affected commune \u2013 Kbal Tuek\nin Kampong Chhnang province.\n131. The site is located at a distance of between 3 \u2013 6 km to the closest upgraded road.\nThere are no tarmac or gravel roads leading to the site. Existing bumpy roads/trails might need\nto be broadened, cleared and reinforced to allow for heavy-duty transport. It is likely that the\nconstruction of a completely new all-weather access road is required.\n51 World Bank (2017). Environmental and Social Framework. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\nWashington, DC.\n58\n59\nFigure 3: Predefined and extended land map\n4.3 Project area of influence\n132. The project area of influence includes localized impacts arising from noise, vibration\nand dust and trans-boundary impacts with wider geographical impacts, such as GHG\nemissions associated with material transport and PV panel production52 and disturbance to\nbird/bats flyways due to the operation of the solar plant.\n133. For the purposes of establishing the environmental baseline and assessing the\npotential environmental impacts, the area of influence for impacts on 60-MW solar plant\necology is taken as 3 km radius. Particular attention was paid to identify:\n\u00a7 Sensitive natural environmental receptors such as water bodies, biodiversity and\nwildlife habitats;\n\u00a7 Sensitive human receptors such as households, schools;\n\u00a7 Cultural and heritage sites (such as temples and animism sites); and\n\u00a7 Potential health and safety issues.\n134. According to IFC-PS1 2012 -, the area of influence encompasses:\n\u00a7 (i) The project53 and the client's activities and facilities that are directly owned,\noperated or managed (including by contractors) and that are a component of the\nproject;54\n\u00a7 (ii) impacts from unplanned but predictable developments caused by the project that\nmay occur later or at a different location; and\n\u00a7 (iii) indirect project impacts on biodiversity or on ecosystem services upon which\nAffected Communities' livelihoods are dependent.\n135. Cumulative impacts55 that result from the incremental impact, on areas and resources\nused or directly impacted by the project, from other existing, planned or reasonably defined\ndevelopments at the time the risks and impacts identification process is conducted. GS6 is an\nexisting facility of the sovereign NSP project and is only indirectly related to PRAC's 60MW\nsolar plant.\n4.4 Baseline Receptor Summary\n136. The following section of the ESIA provides the description of the baseline environment\nfor the project components for PRAC's 60MW solar plant Key receptors information was\nobtained and collated based on-site visits, stakeholder consultations, socio-economic survey,\nbiodiversity assessment, discussions and interviews with local authorities during this ESIA\nprepration. A summary table for key receptors is provided in Table 12 while Figure 5 & 6\npresents the project location with receptor information.\n52 PV panel production is energy intensive and causes depletion of some natural resources, because bulk semiconductor\nmaterial is needed in high quantities (Tsoutsos et al. 2005).\n53 Examples include the project's sites, the immediate airshed and watershed, or transport corridors.\n54 Examples include power transmission corridors, pipelines, canals, tunnels, relocation and access roads, borrow and\ndisposal areas, construction camps, and contaminated land (e.g. soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediments).\n55 Cumulative impacts are limited to those impacts generally recognized as important on the basis of scientific concerns\nand/or concerns from Affected Communities. Examples of cumulative impacts include: incremental contribution of\ngaseous emissions to an airshed; reduction of water flows in a watershed due to multiple withdrawals; increases in\nsediment loads to a watershed; interference with migratory routes or wildlife movement; or more traffic congestion and\naccidents due to increases in vehicular traffic on community roadways.\n60\n61\nTable 12: Summary of Environmentally and Socially Sensitive Receptors for 60MW Solar Plant\nProvince Project Commune Surface Water Socio-Economic and Land Cover/ Existing Protected Area\n/ District Component s Affected Receptors Cultural Receptors Ecological Utilities\nReceptors Affected\nTuek 60MW Solar Kbal Tuek Two natural streams No habitations / settlements Scrubland None None in close\nPhos P lant transecting across the within the proposed the 60 (293 ha) and proximity to the\nDistrict, length of the proposed MW solar plant or private paddy fields proposed site;\nKampong the 60 MW solar plant ownership with formal land (116 ha); Phnom Aural\nChhnang site with inflow coming titles or traditional land small National Protected\nP rovince from Upper Catchment holding; police owned plantations Area located within\nAural and feeding into farmland in close vicinity such as 20 km of site;\n\u201cAn Long Chrey\u201d reservoir cassava, 300 ha\nlocated downstream at a mango, Community forest in\ndistance of approximately cashew, Chean Laeung\n4-5 km; the reservoir may eucalyptus located 5-7 km from\nfunction as a stop off and bamboo proposed the 60 MW\npoint for migratory birds are also solar plant in the\npresent northeast direction56.\nSamaki Existing Chhean The existing access road There are local residents There are (1) This existing There is also a Tbeng\nMeanche access road Loeung runs through two villages: living along the access road.

The objectives of the study are to:\n\u00a7 Collect data on elevation of the project site where there are low/high elevation\nand slopes\n\u00a7 Collect current positions including coordinates of all important topographical\nfeaturesin and around the project site\n\u00a7 Study the catchment area of the project site\n138. Methodology \u2013 The ESIA assessment team used ASTER GDEM data available at the\nMinistry of Economics, Commerce, and Industry, Japan, and at NASA, USA, in 2011. Moreover,\nthe assessment team utilizes ArcMap10 to investigate slopes with the ASTER GDEM data\ngathered within a 1-kilometer radius around the proposed facilities.\n139. The topography of the project site consists of gentle hills. To the south of the site\ntopographic relief decreases as the border with Kampong Speu province is approached. The\nproject area itself is dominated by gently undulating terrain at elevations ranging from 80 m\nto 200 m above sea level, with some isolate d scattered hills rising to around 400 m. The area\nis dissected by numerous ephemeral drainages that flow into the perennial An Long Chrey\nReservoir. There are no large lakes or major rivers in and around the project site. Residents\ngenerally establish settlements near streams or irrigation channels and along the existing\naccess road running through the Royas and Chhoun Chet villages in Chhean Loeung commune.\n140. The Project area is covered with degraded scrubland due to heavy agricultural\npractices and clearing associated with local settlements. The area is mostly covered by the\ngrass and small shrubs.\n4.5.2 Soil quality\n141. Methodology: The ESIA team collected soil data i.e. types, quality, and uses for\ndifferent purposes in and around the project site. The project activities will not pose significant\nrisks to soil quality and uses, the assessment team depends very much on existing data and\ndocuments and collected one soil sample (X=433651, Y=1303521) (Figure 10) for laboratory\ntesting. Soil quality parameters are listed in the table below. The following soil parameters\nwere referred to the suggested list by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery, and Forestry (MAFF)\n(Table 13) for any soil quality study in Cambodia. A quick soil survey of the anticipated project\nfootprint is conducted to characterize soil types within the project area to understand how\neroded it is based on the current state (i.e. erosion potential, storm water run-off quality and\nrehabilitation efforts) and land use practices.\n142. To collect the soil sample, a soil auger was used to drill deep straight into the ground,\nup to 50cm to get the best estimate of soil nutrient levels. Multiple soil cores were taken to\nreduce the chance of pulling one from a 'bad spot'. The collected cores were kept in a clean\nand labeled plastic bag with a total weight of 0.5kg. The sample was submitted to the MAFF's\nlaboratory on the same day of sampling. Photograps were taken to record the existing\nconditions of the sampling location.\n64\n65\nPhoto 1: Soil sampling activities in Solar Plant on 22 September 2020\nSoil Sampling Location X=433651, Y=1303521\n143. Soils in Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu provinces are typically clayey and\nphysically inferior, with relatively low soil fertility. Coarse grained granite rocks of Oral\nMountain located in the west of Kampong Chhnang province and some hilly outcrops in the\nprovince. Despite the poor soil quality, arable farming is common. The predominant soil types\nin the project site are Grey hydromorphics (82 ha) and red-yellow podzols (18 ha) (Figure 7).\n144. The results show that all parameters are below MAFF's soil fertility guideline levels for\nhealthy soil. Nutrient levels are relatively high indicating good fertility. Total nitrogen in the\nproject site is only 0.22% that is in the medium range if compared with the soil fertility level.\nThere is a very high organic matter (4.35%) in the project site. But the test result shows that\ntotal phosphorus has only 0.02% in the project site which is low.

Moisture plays a role of accelerating the decomposition process\nof organic matters in the soil, i.e. it keeps soil fertile and increases in the growth of crops.\nThe laboratory result indicates that soil moisture in the project site is in range of 1.26%\nto 1.82% that is known to be low.\n\u00a7 Based on the standard of Directorate of Agriculture Department (2015), total carbon has\nfive levels in soil \u2013 1. very high (>2.0%), 2. high (1.7%-2.0%), 3. medium (0.8%-1.7%), 4.\nlow (0.4%-0.7%), 5. very low (<0.4%). The test result shows that total carbon in the\nproject site has 2.53% that is very high.\n\u00a7 Total nitrogen is important for agricultural crops especially supporting the growth of the\ncrops. The laboratory result shows that total nitrogen in the project site is only 0.22%\nthat is in the medium range if compared with the soil fertility level determined by the\nMinistry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry (MAFF).\n\u00a7 CN (C/N Ratio) is a factor of soil decomposition that determined the ways and levels of\ndecomposing the organic matter in soil by the bacteria. The result indicates that the\nproject site has such ratio of 12 meaning that there is a good decomposition for\nagricultural crops (based on MAFF's soil fertility is from 8.0-13).\n\u00a7 Organic matter helps us understand the nutrient and organic levels of each soil layers in\nsupporting the growth of the crops. The laboratory test result shows that there is a very\nhigh organic matter (4.35%) in the project site.\n\u00a7 Total phosphorus (P205) is a nutrient needed by the organisms for their living process.\nSuch nutrient is found in rocks, soil, and organic matter. Total phosphorus is essential for\nplanting crops and consists in every cell of lives including plant and animal. Phosphorus\nattaches strongly to soil particles and is used by the plants. The test result shows that\ntotal phosphorus has only 0.02% in the project site which is low.\n\u00a7 Available phosphorus Bray II in the project site has 24ppm. This result indicates that this\nphosphorus in the soil is in the medium level.\n\u00a7 Cation exchange capacity is used to measure the soil fertility, to determine the nutrient\nmaintenance, and to prevent groundwater from being contaminated by other pollutants.\nThe result shows that the cation exchange capacity is 14.50 me/100g soil \u2013 meaning that\nit is the medium capacity.\n\u00a7 The cation exchange has key components such as Ca, Mg, Na, and K. This group has a\nhigh capacity to absorb the soil nutrient and helps accelerate the growth of plan and\ncrop. The result indicates that soil in the project site has 7.60 me/100g of Calcium (Ca),\nthat is low; 2.20 me/100g of Magnesium (Mg) is found to be medium; and 2.89 me/100g\nof Sodium (Na) is known to be low; and 0.64 me/100g of Potasium (K) is medium.\n\u00a7 The total exchangeable bases refer to the sum of other components such as calcium,\nmagnesium, sodium, and potasium. Based on the test result, this exchangeable base is\nonly 13.33 me/100g soil \u2013 indicating that the total exchangeable base is low.\n\u00a7 The bass saturation has a relation with the cation exchange capacity (Ca, Mg, Na, K). If\nbass saturation is high, it means that the acidity level in soil is more neutralized for a\nshort time, than the soil with low saturation. The result shows that the bass saturation\nis 92% which indicates the very high saturation.\n\u00a7 The exchange AL is an important factor affecting the productivity of the agricultural crop\nin the tropical climate. This exchange AL is related with the soil fertility and if it is high,\nthen it means that soil quality is low. The test result shows this AL has only 0.22 me/100g\nsoil that means it is low. Moreover, the electrode conductivity result is only 191 which\nis very low.\n\u00a7 The pH H20 is essential to measure the potentiality of nutrient and polluted components\nfor the plants. Plants grow well when the pH is between 5.7 and 7. The result shows that\npH is 9.02 which it is more alkaline. While the pH KCL in the soil in the project site is 8.12\n\u2013 indicating that there is a high acidity.\n68\n69\nFigure 7: Soil types in the solar plant\nSource: YRDC (2020)\n4.5.3 Climate\n145. The objectives of the climate and meteorology baseline studies are to:\n\u00a7 Identify and describe meteorological data sources relevant to the project;\n\u00a7 Characterize the existing and historical meteorological conditions in the project\nregion; and\n\u00a7 Characterize the meteorological conditions of the project area.\n146. Methodology \u2013 Baseline climate and meteorological conditions of the Project area are\ndetermined and climatic variability is assessed based on available on site data and long-term\nrecords from regional sites. This includes the assessment of:\n\u00a7 Rainfall, including assessment of extreme rainfall events;\n\u00a7 Temperature;\n\u00a7 Evaporation; and\n\u00a7 Humidity.\n147. Cambodia is situated in a tropical zone between 10 and 14 degrees latitude north of\nthe equator. The climate is dominated by the monsoon cycle with a distinct dry season and\nwet season. The northeast monsoon brings in the dry season from November to April. The dry\nseason is cooler from November to January when cool air from Siberia flows in and is dry and\nhot from February to April. The wet season is from May to October, as southwest monsoon\nbrings in moisture and rains from the Indian Ocean. Most provinces experience an average\nwind speed of less than 3 m/s. The maximum wind speed in the rainy season is over 20 m/s\nwhile it is lower during the dry season.\n(A) Temperature\n148. Data recorded by the meteorological station in Kampong Chhnang province indicates\nmean monthly maximum temperatures of 32.7\u201339.2\u00b0C, with a minimum in December and\nmaximum in April. The annual average temperature from 2016-2018 is only 35.2\u00b0C, in which\n2017 has the lowest average. At the same time, the mean monthly average minimum\ntemperature is from 17.9-22.4\u00b0C, where the lowest is in December and highest is in March.\n21\u00b0C is the annual average temperature among the three years, and 2018 has the lowest\nannual average (19\u00b0C).\nTable 15: Temperature data in Kampong Chhnang province from 2016-2018\nAnnual\nMonth Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\nAverage\nYear\nMaximum\n2016 36.0 36.2 39.5 41.5 40.3 37.5 35.0 34.5 35.5 33.0 35.0 32.5 36.4\n2017 33.5 34.0 36.0 38.1 37.5 35.0 34.6 33.5 33.4 33.3 32.5 31.1 34.4\n2018 32.6 34.0 35.1 38.0 36.0 35.0 35.5 34.0 33.5 34.0 34.5 34.5 34.7\nAverg 34.0 34.7 36.9 39.2 37.9 35.8 35.0 34.0 34.1 33.4 34.0 32.7 35.2\nMinimum\n2016 20.0 18.5 24.5 22.5 25.5 23.7 22.0 23.0 23.0 23.0 23.5 20.5 22.5\n2017 18.5 19.5 21.5 23.3 23.5 23.0 22.7 22.6 23.2 22.2 20.5 15.8 21.4\n2018 17.1 19.0 21.2 19.0 20.0 19.5 19.5 18.5 19.5 19.0 18.5 17.5 19.0\n70\n\n\n--- Table on Page 83 ---\n|  |  |  | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | June | July | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec | Annual\nAverage |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Month |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Year |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Maximum |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2016 |  |  | 36.0 | 36.2 | 39.5 | 41.5 | 40.3 | 37.5 | 35.0 | 34.5 | 35.5 | 33.0 | 35.0 | 32.5 | 36.4 |  |\n| 2017 |  |  | 33.5 | 34.0 | 36.0 | 38.1 | 37.5 | 35.0 | 34.6 | 33.5 | 33.4 | 33.3 | 32.5 | 31.1 | 34.4 |  |\n| 2018 |  |  | 32.6 | 34.0 | 35.1 | 38.0 | 36.0 | 35.0 | 35.5 | 34.0 | 33.5 | 34.0 | 34.5 | 34.5 | 34.7 |  |\n| Averg |  |  | 34.0 | 34.7 | 36.9 | 39.2 | 37.9 | 35.8 | 35.0 | 34.0 | 34.1 | 33.4 | 34.0 | 32.7 | 35.2 |  |\n|  | Minimum |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2016 |  |  | 20.0 | 18.5 | 24.5 | 22.5 | 25.5 | 23.7 | 22.0 | 23.0 | 23.0 | 23.0 | 23.5 | 20.5 | 22.5 |  |\n| 2017 |  |  | 18.5 | 19.5 | 21.5 | 23.3 | 23.5 | 23.0 | 22.7 | 22.6 | 23.2 | 22.2 | 20.5 | 15.8 | 21.4 |  |\n| 2018 |  |  | 17.1 | 19.0 | 21.2 | 19.0 | 20.0 | 19.5 | 19.5 | 18.5 | 19.5 | 19.0 | 18.5 | 17.5 | 19.0 |  |\n\n71\nAverg 18.5 19.0 22.4 21.6 23.0 22.1 21.4 21.4 21.9 21.4 20.8 17.9 21.0\nFigure 8: Maximum and minimum temperature from 2016-2018\n39,2\n34 34,7 36,9 37,9 35,8 35 34 34,1 33,4 34 32,7\n22,4 21,6 23 22,1 21,4 21,4 21,9 21,4 20,8\n18,5 19 17,9\nJan Feb Mar Apri May June July Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\nAverage Maximum Average Minimum\n(B) Rainfall\n149.

The objectives of the air quality assessment are to:\n\u00a7 Review the available baseline air quality monitoring data, and collect any further\ndata required to ensure that there is a sufficient baseline for the project area;\n\u00a7 Identify appropriate noise, vibration and air quality assessment criteria, where\navailable;\n\u00a7 Characterise the existing air quality and noise/vibration in the project area\n\u00a7 Estimate the potential sources for vibration, air and noise emissions from the\nproject, and identify any potential impacts on sensitive receptors\n\u00a7 Identify suitable management and mitigation measures that will minimise any\ndirect adverse effects from vibration, noise and air emissions associated with the\nProject.\n151. Methodology\n\u00a7 An air quality baseline is established for the project area through the field sampling\nwith MoE laboratory team in September 2020. Prior to this, available air quality\nmonitoring data was reviewed.\n\u00a7 The potential impacts of air emissions from the project were assessed, and\nmanagement measures to prevent or minimize any identified impact are\nrecommended. The primary air quality issue requiring assessment is likely to be the\ngeneration of dust from transportation mostly. Additionally, greenhouse gas\nemissions, for example those associated with energy usage, were considered during\nthe assessment.\n\u00a7 The assessment of potential air quality impacts was undertaken by analysing the\nexploration plan and using relevant emission factors to estimate the quantity of\ntotal suspended particulate matter (TSP), sub-2.5 and sub-10 micron particles\n(PM10, PM2.5) that would be emitted from each operation. In addition, more\nparameters were analysed namely NO2, SO2, CO, Pb, and O3 as listed below. The\nsite meteorological data relevant to air quality issues was reviewed \u2013 in particular,\nrainfall and temperature.\n\u00a7 The current study collected two samples\u2013 (1) within the project site ANV01\n72\n\n\n--- Table on Page 85 ---\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n\n73\n(X=434264, Y=1303047) and (2) near the existing access road ANV02 (X=439465,\nY=1303928) (Figure 10).\n\u00a7 Potential impacts of all significant air emissions from the project are assessed with\nrespect to the relevant Cambodian standards (MoE's Declaration in 2018), and\nappropriate management measures to prevent or minimize identified impacts were\nrecommended.

Field visits indicated that air quality in the project site was good as the project areas\nare located in rural areas without significant industrial/commercial zones to cause air quality\ndegradation or high noise levels. Typically, in Cambodia, outside Phnom Penh or town centers\nthere are few industrial pollution sources and the volume of vehicular traffic is low. There was\nno available air quality data or noise level measurement for the project provinces. Air quality\nand noise monitoring were taken to inform the environmental baseline in this ESIA for this\nsolar plant.\n153. The baseline for air quality within and around the project site is carefully studied to\ncapture the current situation and how it is already influenced by the surrounding projects.\nThe study collects the field air parameters in two different locations as indicated above (Figure\n10) based on the selected parameters (i.e. TSP, O3, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO and Lead) as\nagreed in the terms of reference. Test was conducted for 24 hours on site, starting from 10am\ntill 10am in the next day. Assessment of the baseline air quality is based on Cambodian quality\nstandards and the result is listed in the Table 18 below.\n74\n75\nTable 18: Air quality result\nNo. Parameters Unit Result Result MoE IFC Standard Analytical Method\n(1) (2) Standard\n1 CO mg/m3 0.41 0.93 <20 NA GRI-IAT (Real-time Monitor)\n(8 hours)\n2 NO2 mg/m3 0.022 0.015 <0.10 <0.2 mg/m3 GRI-IAT (Real-time Monitor)\n(24 hours) (1 hour)\n3 SO2 mg/m3 0.028 0.034 <0.30 <0.02 mg/m3 GRI-IAT (Real-time Monitor)\n(24 hours) (24 hour)\n4 O3 mg/m3 0.031 0.02 <0.20 <0.1 mg/m3 GRI-IAT (Real-time Monitor)\n(1 hour) (8 hours)\n5 Pb mg/m3 ND ND 0.005 NA CPSC-CH-E1002-08.3, (HNO3\n(24 hours) Digestion)\n6 TSP mg/m3 0.011 0.018 <0.33 NA OCEANUS OC-9500, Dust Monitor\n(24 hours) System\n7 PM10 mg/m3 0.007 0.013 <0.05 <0.05 mg/m3 OCEANUS OC-9500, Dust Monitor\n(24 hours) (24 hours) System\n8 PM2.5 mg/m3 0.006 0.009 <0.025 <0.025 OCEANUS OC-9500, Dust Monitor\n(24 hours) mg/m3 System\n(24 hours)\nNote: ND= Not Detected, NA= Not Available\nSource: Test result is generated by the Department of Air and Noise Quality Control (2020)\n154. The IFC ambient air quality guideline in 2007 (based on WHO Air Quality Guideline in\n2005) does not regulate the standard for CO, TSP and Pb, but covers the rest. Unlike the\nMinistry of Environment, the eight critical parameters are determined as illustrated in the\nabove table. Values of the parameters in the second location (near the existing access road)\nseem a little bit higher than those in the project site. This is because of more traffic and\ncommuting activities of the local people on and around the road. However, the results from\nthe two sampling sites are below the MoE's standards. When compared with the IFC, also they\nare all under the determined threshold values, except the SO2 which is slightly above the limit\ndue to the frequent traffic specially in testing location 2 (near the main road).\n4.5.5 Noise\n155. Methodology\n\u00a7 Available noise monitoring data was reviewed. Further fieldwork was required to\nensure that a sufficient baseline for noise levels is available.\n\u00a7 Potential noise sources and sensitive receptors (e.g. local villages) were identified.\nThe project construction and operation plans are analysed to determine the\nlocations of equipment including trucks, bulldozers, drills and other fixed and\nmobile equipment required for construction works.\n\u00a7 The study collected two samples to build the baseline of noise for the project.\nLocations selected are (1) within the project site ANV01 (X=434264, Y=1303047)\nand (2) near the existing access road ANV02 (X=439465, Y=1303928) (Figure 10\nbelow).\n\u00a7 The potential impacts of noise generating activities on sensitive receptors such as\nlocal villages were assessed based on Cambodian and international standards that\nare referenced where appropriate. Potential noise impacts on sensitive receptors\nlocated along the likely transportation and access routes are assessed.\n\u00a7 Management and mitigation measures were developed that helps minimise any\ndirect adverse effects associated with noise from the project. This includes a\nframework for ongoing noise monitoring, including recommendations for\n\n\n--- Table on Page 88 ---\n| No. | Parameters | Unit | Result\n(1) | Result\n(2) | MoE\nStandard | IFC Standard | Analytical Method |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | CO | mg/m3 | 0.41 | 0.93 | <20\n(8 hours) | NA | GRI-IAT (Real-time Monitor) |\n| 2 | NO2 | mg/m3 | 0.022 | 0.015 | <0.10\n(24 hours) | <0.2 mg/m3\n(1 hour) | GRI-IAT (Real-time Monitor) |\n| 3 | SO2 | mg/m3 | 0.028 | 0.034 | <0.30\n(24 hours) | <0.02 mg/m3\n(24 hour) | GRI-IAT (Real-time Monitor) |\n| 4 | O3 | mg/m3 | 0.031 | 0.02 | <0.20\n(1 hour) | <0.1 mg/m3\n(8 hours) | GRI-IAT (Real-time Monitor) |\n| 5 | Pb | mg/m3 | ND | ND | 0.005\n(24 hours) | NA | CPSC-CH-E1002-08.3, (HNO3\nDigestion) |\n| 6 | TSP | mg/m3 | 0.011 | 0.018 | <0.33\n(24 hours) | NA | OCEANUS OC-9500, Dust Monitor\nSystem |\n| 7 | PM10 | mg/m3 | 0.007 | 0.013 | <0.05\n(24 hours) | <0.05 mg/m3\n(24 hours) | OCEANUS OC-9500, Dust Monitor\nSystem |\n| 8 | PM2.5 | mg/m3 | 0.006 | 0.009 | <0.025\n(24 hours) | <0.025\nmg/m3\n(24 hours) | OCEANUS OC-9500, Dust Monitor\nSystem |\n\nmonitoring locations and frequency.\n\u00a7 The assessment and management of potential noise impacts were based upon the\n(a) Declaration on Uses of Terms of Reference for Establishing Factory and\nHandicraft (2018), and (b) IFC EH&S Guidelines (2007)\nTable 19: MoE's noise standards\nNoise by time Standard* IFC (2007)**\nDay Time (6:00-18:00) 75 dB(A) 55 dB(A)\nEvening Time (18:00-22:00) 70 dB(A)\nNight Time (22:00-6:00) 50 dB(A) 45 dB(A)\nNote: *Declaration on Uses of Term of Reference for Establishment of Factory and Handicraft (2018),\n** IFC (2007).

Table 20 below lists the result of the observed noise level for 24 hours in two locations\n\u2013 (1) within the project site, and (2) near the existing access road (Figure 10). Hourly LAeg\nnoise at the two sampling sites was found to be below the standard of Cambodia standard.\nResult from location 2 (near the access road) recorded the slightly higher value than the\nlocation 1 and this is due to high mobility of the local villagers. Noise is observed to increase\nfrom 11:00-12:00 am and 19:00-20:00 at night. The average 24-hour noise level of location 1\nis recorded at 47.20 dBA and 54.84 dBA is for location 2. When compared with the IFC's\nresidential standard for both day and night times, the results from the two locations can be\ninferred a little bit higher the guideline values in the day-time but critically sensitive at night\nfrom 22:00 to 6:00 in the morning. The frequent transportation of the products from factory\n(Mountain Rock Manufacturing) which is about 3-4km away from project site and access road\nis doubtful to be causing such disturbing noise.\nTable 20: Noise level observed in and around the project site\nObserved Time Noise Level [dB(A)]\nResult (1) Result (2) MoE's IFC's Standard\n(Average) (Average) Standard\nDay 6:00-7:00 44.30 58.50 70 Residential\n7:00-8:00 45.40 53.90 (Day-Time) \u2013 55\n8:00-9:00 54.20 53.00\n9:00-10:00 40.80 56.50\n10:00-11:00 46.10 46.10\n11:00-12:00 46.80 67.90\n12:00-13:00 51.10 53.10\n13:00-14:00 49.40 52.20\n14:00-15:00 42.70 52.60\n15:00-16:00 42.30 56.50\n16:00-17:00 33.20 57.60\n17:00-18:00 34.10 54.20\nEvening 18:00-19:00 43.70 53.80 65\n19:00-20:00 49.00 60.60\n20:00-21:00 49.60 59.00\n21:00-22:00 52.00 60.40\nNight 22:00-23:00 52.40 58.70 50\n23:00-00:00 52.80 52.80\n76\n\n\n--- Table on Page 89 ---\n| Noise by time | Standard* | IFC (2007)** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Day Time (6:00-18:00) | 75 dB(A) | 55 dB(A) |\n| Evening Time (18:00-22:00) | 70 dB(A) |  |\n| Night Time (22:00-6:00) | 50 dB(A) | 45 dB(A) |\n\n\n\n--- Table on Page 89 ---\n| Observed Time |  | Noise Level [dB(A)] |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Result (1)\n(Average) | Result (2)\n(Average) | MoE's\nStandard | IFC's Standard |\n| Day | 6:00-7:00 | 44.30 | 58.50 | 70 | Residential\n(Day-Time) \u2013 55 |\n|  | 7:00-8:00 | 45.40 | 53.90 |  |  |\n|  | 8:00-9:00 | 54.20 | 53.00 |  |  |\n|  | 9:00-10:00 | 40.80 | 56.50 |  |  |\n|  | 10:00-11:00 | 46.10 | 46.10 |  |  |\n|  | 11:00-12:00 | 46.80 | 67.90 |  |  |\n|  | 12:00-13:00 | 51.10 | 53.10 |  |  |\n|  | 13:00-14:00 | 49.40 | 52.20 |  |  |\n|  | 14:00-15:00 | 42.70 | 52.60 |  |  |\n|  | 15:00-16:00 | 42.30 | 56.50 |  |  |\n|  | 16:00-17:00 | 33.20 | 57.60 |  |  |\n|  | 17:00-18:00 | 34.10 | 54.20 |  |  |\n| Evening | 18:00-19:00 | 43.70 | 53.80 | 65 |  |\n|  | 19:00-20:00 | 49.00 | 60.60 |  |  |\n|  | 20:00-21:00 | 49.60 | 59.00 |  |  |\n|  | 21:00-22:00 | 52.00 | 60.40 |  |  |\n| Night | 22:00-23:00 | 52.40 | 58.70 | 50 |  |\n|  | 23:00-00:00 | 52.80 | 52.80 |  |  |\n\n77\n00:00-1:00 47.40 53.00 Residential\n1:00-2:00 49.30 51.70 (Night-Time) -\n2:00-3:00 53.30 52.60 45\n3:00-4:00 53.70 49.90\n4:00-5:00 53.60 50.00\n5:00-6:00 45.60 51.50\n24 Hours 47.20 54.84\nSource: Test result is generated by the Department of Air and Noise Quality Control (2020)\n4.5.6 Vibration\n157.

Ground vibration was measured at the two locations \u2013 (1) in the project site, and (2)\nnear the existing access road for 10 minutes every 1-3 hours. The vibration results are similar\nwith the results of the noise level in a way that they are all below the MoE's standard across\nthe 24 hours, and the location 2 has higher values than those in location 1. Same reason for\nsuch bigger values is due to the more frequent travels of trucks transporting factory products\nto Phnom Penh. The average 24-hour vibration level is 19.06 dB for location 1 and 23.16 dB\nfor location 2, which these values are far below the standards \u2013 65 dB for day and 60 dB for\nnight.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 90 ---\n|  | 00:00-1:00 | 47.40 | 53.00 |  | Residential\n(Night-Time) -\n45 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 1:00-2:00 | 49.30 | 51.70 |  |  |\n|  | 2:00-3:00 | 53.30 | 52.60 |  |  |\n|  | 3:00-4:00 | 53.70 | 49.90 |  |  |\n|  | 4:00-5:00 | 53.60 | 50.00 |  |  |\n|  | 5:00-6:00 | 45.60 | 51.50 |  |  |\n| 24 Hours |  | 47.20 | 54.84 |  |  |\n\n\n\n--- Table on Page 90 ---\n| Vibration by time | Standard* |\n| --- | --- |\n| Day Time (6:00-18:00) | 65 dB |\n| Night Time (18:00-6:00) | 60 dB |\n\nTable 22: Vibration level observed in and around the project site\nObserved Time Vibration Level dB\nResult (1) (Average) Result (2) (Average) MoE's Standard\nDay 6:00-7:00 20.40 26.90 65\n7:00-8:00 19.20 26.70\n8:00-9:00 24.70 26.70\n9:00-10:00 20.30 29.80\n10:00-11:00 23.20 25.50\n11:00-12:00 22.60 23.70\n12:00-13:00 24.30 23.30\n13:00-14:00 20.50 27.10\n14:00-15:00 20.30 27.40\n15:00-16:00 18.00 30.50\n16:00-17:00 20.90 27.20\n17:00-18:00 18.60 24.50\nNight 18:00-19:00 20.30 24.40 60\n19:00-20:00 17.70 17.30\n20:00-21:00 17.50 17.30\n21:00-22:00 16.40 18.00\n22:00-23:00 15.80 17.60\n23:00-00:00 22.10 17.20\n00:00-1:00 15.60 17.30\n1:00-2:00 15.40 16.60\n2:00-3:00 15.70 18.50\n3:00-4:00 16.10 17.30\n4:00-5:00 15.80 17.00\n5:00-6:00 16.00 28.50\n24 Hours 19.06 23.16\nSource: Test result is generated by the Department of Air and Noise Quality Control (2020)\n4.5.7 Surface and groundwater quality\n(A) Surface Water Quality\n159.

These waterways run through and are close to the project site (Figure 12).\nThese two streams run at full capacity during the rainy season when water usually floods their\nedges, banks and other riparian plants and trees, but less in dry season. These two streams\nare essential habitats for aquatic biodiversity. Any physical change, flow and water quality may\npose critical concerns over their resources.\n160.

For surface water sampling, the study documented the current condition of water\nquality in one stream by testing water sample from 2 locations (Figure 10) \u2013 (1) in Preak Mkak\nclosed to the project boundary [SW01 (X= 433561, Y=1303122)] and (2) in the small canal\nwithin the project boundary [SW02 (X=434129, Y=1303449)]. Parameters for water testing are\ndescribed below.\nCambodian water quality legislation and standards\n\u00a7 Sub-decree on Water Pollution Control (1999)\n\u00a7 Law on Water Resources Management in Cambodia (2007)\n\u00a7 Drinking Water Quality Standards (2004)\nInternational water quality standards\n\u00a7 World Bank/IFC Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines (2007); and\n\u00a7 WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, fourth edition (2011)\n163. The general procedure for surface water sampling was as follows:\n\u00a7 Bottles were labelled with site ID and date\n\u00a7 Gloves were used to prevent sample contamination\n\u00a7 Bottles (500 mL) were filled with sample water without headspace\n\u00a7 Bottles were sealed carefully\n\u00a7 Bottles samples were chilled\n164. Surface Water. The proposed 60 MW solar plant is located upstream of a reservoir that\nserves a 170 kW micro-hydro An Long Chrey project. The reservoir gathers the interflow from\nthree main streams57 (source - upper catchment Aural) with major inflow from Stung Chreav\nstream. Two of these streams transect the project site while Stung Chreav stream bypasses\nthe proposed project site by a distance of 1.6 km (Figure 12). These two streams are the only\nsurface water bodies within the proposed solar plant site and will be conserved in its current\nnatural condition.58 Preliminary findings from the hydrological study suggests that the An Long\nChrey reservoir experiences overflow during operation on recurring basis; in February 2012\nthe overflow extended up to 1.5 km from the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site. The\nreservoir is located approximately 4 to 5 km from the site, therefore overflow will not be an\nissue. As seen in the area, there are no protected surface water bodies within the project area\nof influence, except the An Long Chrey.\n165. The surface water test results are presented in the table below. The surface water\n57 They are (1) Stueng Kraing Ponley, (2) Stueng Chreav, and (3) Preak Mkak.\n58 The important habitat within the proposed solar park are the natural streams and it is necessary to conserve these streams\nin its natural state and establish a buffer of 100 m on both sides, Source: Project Biodiversity Assessment, July 2018.\nquality test results show that parameters of the water quality are all under the allowable\nstandards permitted by the Ministry of Environment (see Table 23 below) for public water\nprotection. DO is very good in both locations which mean that the water supports the\necosystems very well. Heavy metal in water is relatively low; for instance, Hg, As, Fe are very\nless presented in water \u2013 posing no serious concern for domestic uses, except for drinking.\nSimilarly, the Total Coliform is high for both locations, which alert the public health issue. Oil\nand grease is high in location two due to there are some clearing activities from the nearby\nfarms. In general, the water quality at the two sampled locations is relatively good with\nrespect to ecosystem health, but is not suitable for drinking.\nTable 23: MoE's parameters for surface water quality standards\nNo. Surface water quality parameters Unit Standard* #1** #2**\n1 Temperature oC <45 25 25\n2 pH - 6-9 6.83 7.5\n3 Total Suspended Solid (TSS) mg/l <120 29 32\n4 Dissolved Oxygen (DO) mg/l >1 5.4 6.4\n5 Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) mg/l <80 1.29 1.4\n6 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) mg/l <100 3.98 4.81\n7 Total Nitrogen (TN) mg/l <6 0.64 0.68\n8 Total Phosphorus (TP) mg/l <5 0.05 0.08\n9 Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) mg/l <2000 34 47\n10 Oil or Grease mg/l <15 11 21.2\n11 Detergent mg/l <15 0.14 0.18\n12 Sulfate (SO4) mg/l <500 6 5\n13 Asenic (As) mg/l <1 0.007 0.008\n14 Iron (Fe) mg/l <20 0.55 0.63\n15 Mercury (Hg) mg/l <0.05 ND 0.0003\n16 Total Coliform mg/l <1000 1.5x103 9.3x103\nNote: *Declaration on Uses of Term of Reference for Establishment of Factory and Handicraft, Ministry of Environment\n(2018), **#1&#2 are the sampled locations\n(B) Groundwater Quality\n166. For groundwater sampling, one sample was collected in a village closed to the project\nsite since there is no borehole located within the 60MW solar plant site. This well located 2\nkilometers, north of the project plant and has been used for one year for mainly domestic use\ni.e. washing and cleaning. The depth of the well where sample is collected is around 40 meters.\nThe sampling location is GW (X=433492, Y=1306328) (Figure 10). Selected parameters for the\ngroundwater are listed in the table below.\n167. Sample collection and analysis methodology: Sample was collected during rainy\nseason. Field parameters are monitored using multi-parameter water quality probes. Sample\nwas also collected in bottles containing the appropriate preservatives for analysis at an\naccredited analytical laboratory (i.e. MoE's laboratory). Consistent with Cambodian and\ninternationally recognized guidelines, the following laboratory parameters for groundwater\nare sampled. The depth to groundwater varies from location to location. The depth is in\nbetween 40-60 meters as the areas closed to solar plant is relatively high with average\nelevitation from 80-200 meters above sea level rise (see section 4.5.1). The groundwater is\nmainly used for agriculture, grazing, and domestic use, but not for drinking.

As reported from the villagers, well runs a\nlittle bit dry during the dry season.\n168. The groundwater quality is tested and the result shows that parameters of water\nquality are well below the human drinking thresholds determined by the Ministry of\nEnvironment. Heavy metals are below the allowable permit for domestic uses, but it is not\nrecommended for any intake. Iron and Al were slightly above the permittable standard. Hg\nand C6H6 could not be detected during the analysis which means that there is no or very less\nHg and C6H6 in the groundwater.\nTable 24: MoE's parameters for groundwater quality\nNo. Parameter Unit Standards* Result\n1 pH - 6.5-8.5 5.8\n2 Turbidity NTU <5 4\n3 Electrode Conductivity (EC) NTU 500-1500 994\n4 Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) mg/l <800 437\n5 Total Hardness (CaCO3) mg/l <300 130\n6 Chloride (Cl) mg/l <250 100\n7 Fluoride (F) mg/l <1.5 0.24\n8 Nitrate (NO3) mg/l <50 2\n9 Sulfate (SO4) mg/l <250 3.4\n10 Iron (Fe) mg/l <0.3 0.35\n11 Arsenic (As) mg/l <0.05 0.009\n12 Mercury (Hg) mg/l <0.001 ND59\n13 Chromium (Cr) mg/l <0.05 0.0008\n14 Manganese (Mn) mg/l <0.1 0.04\n15 Alumimium (Al) mg/l <0.2 0.29\n16 Benzene (C6H6) mg/l <0.01 ND\n17 Cadmium (Cd) mg/l <0.003 0.0004\n18 Total Coliform MPN/100ml 0 0\n19 E-Coli MPN/100ml 0 0\nNote: *Declaration on Uses of Term of Reference for Establishment of Factory and Handicraft (2018), ND= Not Detected\n169. Water Usage and Sources. Information on water usage and source by households in\nthe project-affected communes are included under the Socio-Economic Profile of this section.\nPublic consultations confirmed that the water usage is mainly for household use, feeding\nanimals and irrigation. Water is sourced from local ponds, streams, and river or groundwater\nwells.\n59 The testing faciltities cannot detect it, and it means there is less Hg or absence of Hg in the water.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 94 ---\n| No. | Parameter | Unit | Standards* | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | pH | - | 6.5-8.5 | 5.8 |\n| 2 | Turbidity | NTU | <5 | 4 |\n| 3 | Electrode Conductivity (EC) | NTU | 500-1500 | 994 |\n| 4 | Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) | mg/l | <800 | 437 |\n| 5 | Total Hardness (CaCO3) | mg/l | <300 | 130 |\n| 6 | Chloride (Cl) | mg/l | <250 | 100 |\n| 7 | Fluoride (F) | mg/l | <1.5 | 0.24 |\n| 8 | Nitrate (NO3) | mg/l | <50 | 2 |\n| 9 | Sulfate (SO4) | mg/l | <250 | 3.4 |\n| 10 | Iron (Fe) | mg/l | <0.3 | 0.35 |\n| 11 | Arsenic (As) | mg/l | <0.05 | 0.009 |\n| 12 | Mercury (Hg) | mg/l | <0.001 | ND59 |\n| 13 | Chromium (Cr) | mg/l | <0.05 | 0.0008 |\n| 14 | Manganese (Mn) | mg/l | <0.1 | 0.04 |\n| 15 | Alumimium (Al) | mg/l | <0.2 | 0.29 |\n| 16 | Benzene (C6H6) | mg/l | <0.01 | ND |\n| 17 | Cadmium (Cd) | mg/l | <0.003 | 0.0004 |\n| 18 | Total Coliform | MPN/100ml | 0 | 0 |\n| 19 | E-Coli | MPN/100ml | 0 | 0 |\n\nPhoto 3: Surface water sampling activities on 22 September 2020\nSurface water sampling (Location 1 in Preak Mkak)\nSurface water sampling (Location 2 in small canal within the project site)\nGroundwater sampling activity\n82\n83\nFigure 10: Test locations\nSource: YDRC (2020)\n5.4.8 Hydrology\n170. The objectives of the hydrology study are to:\n\u00a7 Characterize the current baseline hydrology within/near the project area,\nupstream and downstream of the project\n\u00a7 Assess potential impacts on hydrology associated with the project during the\nproject phases\n\u00a7 Identify suitable management measures for minimizing potential impacts on\nhydrology associated with the project\n171. Methodology \u2013 A field visit to document the hydrology baseline in the project area was\nconducted on 22 September 2020. Existing baseline hydrology was reviewed and additional\ndata was collected throughout the ESIA process to ensure that an extensive pre-project\nbaseline was available.\n172. An hydrological study assesses the entire catchment area of the selected site for the\n60 MW solar plant and immediately associated areas. Assessment takes account of peak\nrainfall season (September 2020) and anticipated increases in frequent and/or intense\nextreme weather events. Preliminary assessment shows the proposed project site is outside\nthe flood boundary. Figure 11 presents the site contour generated by Google Earth and ArcGIS\nwhile Figure 12 shows stream inflow at the proposed project site.\n173. In the closed vicinity of the project site, there is a big irrigation reservoir known as An\nLong Chrey, developed by the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, under the Krang\nPonley Water Resources Development Project from November 2009 to February 2012 with\nthe financial support from Republic of Korea. This reservoir locates 48 km from Kampong Speu\nprovince. There are three main streams discharging water into this reservoir, namely Stueng\nKrang Ponley, Stueng Chreav, and Preak Mkak. This reservoir has a total catchment area of\n479km2, and with 6.2km length. The normal height of the water is 69.5m and there are 10\nassociated structures. The reservoir can generate 170kW of electricity. This reservoir is\nbeneficial for agriculture, fishing and domestic consumption. Moreover, there are other six\nassociated canals diverting water to other users.\nPhoto 4: Existing hydrological systems in and around the project site\nKraing Ponley (An Long Chrey) Reservoir (September 2020)\n84\n85\nPraek Mkak (western of the project site) (September 2020)\nSmall creek running in the middle of the project site (September 2020)\nFigure 11: Site Contour in the Area of Influence\nSource: YDRC (2020)\n86\n87\nFigure 12: Stream Inflow in the Area of Influence\nSource: YDRC (2020)\n4.5.8 Natural Hazards\n174. Climate Risks. The the 60 MW solar plant has been screened for climate risks using the\nAWARE climate risk-screening tool60 as part of the NSP and the overall risk level is Medium.\nThe screening noted that the proposed project site is located in a region that may be\npotentially at a High-Level Risk from recurring major flood events and precipitation induced\nlandslides and as such mitigation measures in the design are required. The screening also\nnoted that the proposed project site is at a Medium Level Risk for increase in temperature and\nprecipitation, change in water availability and solar radiation. Following the screening results,\na Climate Risks and Vulnerability Analysis (CRVA) has been undertaken for the NSP. Project\ncomponents sensitive to climate change were identified as listed in Table 25 below. These\npotential impacts are managed through design mitigation measures, where appropriate in\naccordance with the Guidelines for Climate Proofing Investments in the Energy Sector.\nTable 25: Climate Change Impact on the 60 MW solar plant as part of NSP61\nClimate Change Factor Risk Level Potential Impacts\n\u00a7 More frequent and/or intense High \u00a7 Increased risk of direct flood damage\nextreme weather events to solar photovoltaic (PV) plants,\n\u00a7 Recurring flood events drainage canals\n\u00a7 Precipitation induced \u00a7 Increased risk of accelerated surface\nlandslides run-off, soil erosion and\nsedimentation load at site affecting\nland and drainage\n\u00a7 Access/approach roads could be\ndamaged or washed out or segments\ncould be eroded.\n\u00a7 Affected life span of the 60 MW solar\nplant\n\u00a7 Increase in temperature Medium \u00a7 Increased operating challenges to\n\u00a7 Increase in precipitation solar PV plants such as lower cell\n\u00a7 Change in solar radiation efficiency and energy output\n\u00a7 Change in water availability \u00a7 Heat waves stress on roads, buildings\nand other infrastructure\n\u00a7 Increased losses within the\nsubstation and transformers\n\u00a7 Increased risk of corrosion of steel\ninfrastructure (lattice towers) with a\ncorresponding increase in humidity\n\u00a7 Increased risk of drought episodes\nand dust damage to solar PV plants\n60The screening is based on the AwareTM geographic data set, compiled from the latest scientific information on current\ngeological, climate and related hazards together with projected changes for the future where available. These data are\ncombined with the project\u2019s sensitivities to hazard variables, returning information on the current and potential future\nrisks that could influence its design and planning.\n61 Data sources utilized: (i) GMS CEP SEA START RC Climate Change Adaptation Platform, web-link -\nhttp://climatechangeadaptation.gms-eoc.org/home/country; (ii) World Bank\u2019s Climate Change Knowledge Portal; (iii)\nPreliminary findings of the project Hydrological Study; (iv) Think Hazard, web-link: http://thinkhazard.org/en/report/44-\ncambodia/LS; (v) EM-DAT | The international disasters database, web-link: https://www.emdat.be/; (Vi) Guidelines for\nClimate Proofing Investments in the Energy Sector (ADB, 2013).\n88\n\n\n--- Table on Page 101 ---\n|  | Climate Change Factor |  |  | Risk Level |  |  | Potential Impacts |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u00a7 More frequent and/or intense\nextreme weather events\n\u00a7 Recurring flood events\n\u00a7 Precipitation induced\nlandslides |  |  | High |  |  | \u00a7 Increased risk of direct flood damage\nto solar photovoltaic (PV) plants,\ndrainage canals\n\u00a7 Increased risk of accelerated surface\nrun-off, soil erosion and\nsedimentation load at site affecting\nland and drainage\n\u00a7 Access/approach roads could be\ndamaged or washed out or segments\ncould be eroded.\n\u00a7 Affected life span of the 60 MW solar\nplant |  |  |\n| \u00a7 Increase in temperature\n\u00a7 Increase in precipitation\n\u00a7 Change in solar radiation\n\u00a7 Change in water availability |  |  | Medium |  |  | \u00a7 Increased operating challenges to\nsolar PV plants such as lower cell\nefficiency and energy output\n\u00a7 Heat waves stress on roads, buildings\nand other infrastructure\n\u00a7 Increased losses within the\nsubstation and transformers\n\u00a7 Increased risk of corrosion of steel\ninfrastructure (lattice towers) with a\ncorresponding increase in humidity\n\u00a7 Increased risk of drought episodes\nand dust damage to solar PV plants |  |  |\n\n89\nClimate Change Factor Risk Level Potential Impacts\n\u00a7 Less water availability for PV panel\ncleaning and maintenance of\nvegetation within the 60 MW solar\nplant\n175. Extreme Weather Events. Storms and typhoons are not considered a major problem in\nCambodia as surrounding mountain ranges protect the country. However, some storms do\noccasionally affect the country with most storm-related damage caused by localized floods\nassociated with heavy rain. Tropical storms can also affect the level of Mekong River flooding\nand cause flash floods62 as well as increase the risk of precipitation-induced landslides.\n176. Some parts of Kampong Chhnang province were affected by flash floods in the recent\npast. The maximum flood extent in 200063 by the Mekong River flood and the maximum flash\nflood extent in 2011 and 2013 are presented in Figure 13. As seen in the figure, the proposed\nproject site was out of the flood boundary during these events. The project area communes\nreport heavy precipitation and corresponding floods that affected large areas of rice paddy\nfields in 2015. Kampong Chhnang province was affected by drought in January 2002\nconsidered as the worst in two decades by the National Committee of Disaster Management\nand lasted until the onset of rains in mid-August. The project area communes report droughts\nas recurring phenomena during the dry season.\n177. The project region is at low risk for geological hazards such as earthquake, seismic\nlandslide, volcano and tsunami as well as potential decrease in incidences of precipitation.\nTherefore, these were not further elaborated for the purpose of discussion.\n62 The Mekong river floods are a result of the cumulative rainfall in the upper catchment of the Mekong throughout the rainy\nseason. Mekong river floods are common in the provinces of Stung Treng, Kratie, Kampong Cham, Prey Veng, SvayRieng,\nKandal, and Takeo. Flash floods are a result of repeated heavy rainfall in mountainous areas that flow to streams and\ntributaries of the Mekong River. Flash floods are swift, last only a few days but often cause severe damage to crops and\ninfrastructure especially in tributaries around the Tonle Sap Lake.\n63 The year 2000 is considered as the worst flood in the recent history of Cambodia\n\n\n--- Table on Page 102 ---\n|  | Climate Change Factor |  |  | Risk Level |  |  | Potential Impacts |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | \u00a7 Less water availability for PV panel\ncleaning and maintenance of\nvegetation within the 60 MW solar\nplant |  |  |\n\nFigure 13: Flood Extent for Year 2000, 2011 and 201364\n64Source: KCC Consultants for CAM NSPP May 2018\n90\n91\n4.5.9 Protected Areas\n178. Of all Protected Areas in Cambodia, the closest is the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary\nlocated within 20 km from the proposed project site in Aural district of Kampong Speu\nprovince. The sanctuary was designated as a National Protected Area (NPA) as per the Royal\nDecree on Protected Area, 1993. The NPA covers an area of 253,750 ha and contains a variety\nof landforms, elevations and geology and is considered as an important bird and biodiversity\narea. Tonle Sap Lake, a Protected Area is located northwest of the proposed project site at a\ndistance of about 60 \u2013 65 km. The Protected Area is not within the project area of influence\nand will not be impacted by the project. The biodiversity assessment conducted for this\nproject documents the migratory birds flying over the project site to these protected areas.\nThe Phnom Aural National Protected Area and the proposed project site are shown in Figure\n14.\nFigure 14: Project site and near-by protected area\nSource: YDRC (2020)\n4.6 Ecological Resources\n4.6.1 Flora/plant survey\n179. This was to record the existing species presented in the plant site to alert the\nconstruction and management plans of the project in order to avoid disruption or design\nbetter response to keep them as much as possible. Since there was no commercial and large\nplants onsite, the survey was to record the report of the local people who used to get in\naround the plant site and knowledged the local species. Primary methods were:\n\u00a7 Interview with relevant local people and relevant technical departments in the\nKampong Chhnang province\n\u00a7 Certain locations on the water body were visited if necessary to review potential\nhabitats (i.e. An Long Chrey Reservoir). For forest, site review was needed since\nthere was no recent forest cover available.\n180. Quick forest survey and resource uses \u2013 The objectives of the forest survey and forest\nresource use studies are to:\n\u00a7 Describe the status of flora in the project area and identify any high value habitat\nor rare and endangered species\n\u00a7 Describe any local community use of flora collected in the project area\n\u00a7 Record locations and conservation values of nearby protected areas\n\u00a7 Assess the potential impacts of the project on forest resources in the vicinity of the\nproject area\n\u00a7 Develop avoidance, management and mitigation measures for the project,\nincluding proposed measures to offset any unavoidable impacts from the project.\n181. Scope of work and methodology \u2013 Given the location of the proposed project closed\nto the Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and An Long Chrey Reservoir, the current status of terrestrial\nflora in the area and potential impacts needed to be rapidly assessed. Important habitats and\nthe presence of any species of conservation significance were determined. Furthermore, the\nimportance of vegetation resources for subsistence and livelihood uses were also assessed.\nIndigenous knowledge survey was used as well as field surveys where required. The baseline\nstudy presented available information in order to:\n\u00a7 Describe key forest species, distribution, density, and their conservation\nsignificance\n\u00a7 Document the current forest status including their degradation and conservation\n\u00a7 Describe the current uses of these forest resources\n182. There are no protected areas or habitats of particular biodiversity value within the\nproject area of influence. The solar plant site is located in modified environment (disturbed\nby human activity) dominated by scrubland with scattered trees and paddy fields, however it\ncontains two natural streams that transect across the site and these are important for\nconservation since these serve the local habitat (also refer to discussion in Physical Resources\nabove).\n183. The survey of flora was conducted through visiting the site and interviewing local\nvillagers about the presence of existing species records 26 plants and small trees. Shorea\nObtusa (Shorea tumbuggaia) is found and rated by IUCN as Nearly Threatened, but the trees\nare small in diameters which have no economic values. The existing habitats have been\nseverely modified due to agricultural practices including public grazing.

Community forests. The Tbeng Srorng (or Andong Breng) protected community forest\n(located approximately 5-7 km away on the southeast from the proposed solar plant site)\ncovers an area of 254,56 ha and has a mix of diverse tree species that are grown and/or\nregenerated. The habitats located within this community forest can be considered as new\nregenerating natural habitat and a good ecosystem for wildlife. This community forest will not\nbe affected by this project.\nPhoto 6: Tbeng Srorng Community forest\n4.6.2 Fauna survey and resource uses\n185. The objectives of the wildlife survey and resource use studies are to:\n\u00a7 Describe the status of fauna in the project area and identify any high value habitat\nor rare and endangered species\n\u00a7 Describe any local community use of wildlife collected in the project area\n\u00a7 Assess the potential impacts of the project on wildlife biodiversity in the vicinity of\nthe project area\n\u00a7 Develop avoidance, management and mitigation measures for the project,\nincluding proposed measures to offset any unavoidable impacts from the project.\n186. Scope of work and methodology \u2013 Given the location of the proposed project closed\nto the Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and An Long Chrey Reservoir, the current status of terrestrial\nfauna in the area and potential impacts is needed to be rapidly assessed. Important habitats\nand the presence of any species of conservation significance were determined. Furthermore,\nthe importance of wildlife resources for subsistence and livelihood uses were also assessed.\nIndigenous knowledge surveys were used as well as field surveys where required. The\nbaseline study presents available information in order to:\n\u00a7 Describe key wildlife species, distribution, density, and their conservation\nsignificance\n\u00a7 Document the current wildlife status including their uses, threatening factors and\nconservation\n\u00a7 The survey is based on the guide Alan Rabinowiz (2000) and Carl Traeholt (2003).\n187. Management measures for any impacts are developed, and suitable wildlife and\nrehabilitation methods for the project area were identified as part of the ESIA process.\nProposed measures were also developed to offset any unavoidable impacts on biodiversity\nfrom the project.\n188. There were no endemic, rare, threatened or globally endangered species or species of\nparticular conservation value observed during the site visit or identified from consultations\nand historic records at the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site. All bird species recorded or\ntallied during the ground surveys that were conducted in dry season and wet season65 are\nclassified by IUCN as being of Least Concern category, these include regional migratory, local\nmigratory and ground birds.\n189. An Long Chrey reservoir. The reservoir is located downstream of the the 60 MW solar\nplant site at a distance of about 4-5 km. Based on its ecological condition coupled with\nfrequent increases in elevation of stored water especially during rainy season, this site can\nattract some migrant bird species such as Lesser Whistling Duck, Cotton Pygmy Goose, Barn\nSwallow, Asian Palm Swift, House Swift, etc as winter visitors (all IUCN Least Concern\nclassification). These birds migrate via the East Asian \u2013 Australasian Flyway.\n190. 60MW Solar Plant Site. When considering the habitats within the proposed the 60 MW\nsolar plant and the wider surrounding area comprising of scrubland, agricultural farms,\nstreams as well as the downstream reservoir, these are modified habitats. At the 60 MW solar\nplant itself, the presence of two natural streams may support bird species as well as wild pig,\nmuntjac, Burmese hare and other rabbit species (all Least Concern IUCN classification).\n191. Comparison between Survey Results conducted during dry and wet season. Dry season\n65 Dry season survey was conducted in March 2018 and covered the proposed solar park site and an alternative site. Wet\nseason survey was conducted in July 2018 and covered the proposed solar park site (close to the solar park site), An Long\nChrey Reservoir65 and Tbeng Srorng community forest (300 ha) located northeast of proposed solar park in Chean Leung\ncommune at a distance of approximately 4-5 km.\n96\n97\nand wet season surveys for the NSP tallied and recorded a total of 78 and 24 bird species,\nrespectively at the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site. All bird species were of \u201cLeast\nConcern\u201d category as per IUCN. Only 16 bird species were common between dry and wet\nseason surveys. The difference in number of species recorded during the two surveys may be\nattributed to seasonal migration. The dry season survey was conducted in March 2019, which\nis a prime time for bird migration at global, regional and local level while the wet season survey\nwas conducted in July 2019, which is when most of the bird species move away to their\nbreeding or to other foraging grounds. The wet season survey indicates that that there is an\necological connection between stream habitats, reservoir, dipterocarpaceae forest and\nscrubland. The natural streams within the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site serve as the\nfeeding ground for Green Peafowl (Least Concern IUCN classification) while the\nDipterocarpaceae forest in Tbeng Srorng community forest serves as its breeding ground.\nOther bird species may migrate to other nearby areas for feeding and breeding including the\nPhnom Aural Wildlife NPA, the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve of the reservoir, for instance, the\nmigration of egret and heron species from the natural stream to the reservoir. In addition, the\nhabitat of Dipterocarpaceae forest and scrubland is also favorable for local migratory species\nsuch as the eagle.\n192. Community Forests. Tbeng Srorng community forest containing the Dipterocarpaceae\nforest (300 ha) is suitable for wildlife such as Green Peafowl, Red jungle fowl, Wild pig, etc.\nMost of red jungle fowl can breed within this habitat. This forest, located approximately 5-7\nkm northeast of the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site, will not be affected by the proposed\nproject. The local interviews in September 2020 at Royeas village in Chhaen Laeung commune\nreported possible presence of endangered and vulnerable mammals and reptiles within Tbeng\nSrong community forest as seen or heard within the last five years. Species included Dhole,\nFishing Cat (both classified as IUCN Endangered), Asiatic Jackal, and Burmese Python (both\nclassified as IUCN Vulnerable). However, these species and/or suitable habitats for these\nspecies were not identified in the field survey (September 2020). The interviews also\nconfirmed that bird species found are typical of forested areas, wetlands and rural areas.\n193. Mammals: 10 common mammal species were recorded during the field observation\nand in-depth interviews with the local villagers living closed to the project site or having\nwandered around in the project site. These are IUCN Least Concerned mammals and their\npopulation has decreased remarkably in the last five years.\nTable 27: Mammal species recently reported (September 2020)\nNo. English Name Scientific Name Family MAFF IUCN\n1 Wild Boar Sus scrofa Suidae C LC\n2 Red Muntjac Muntiacus muntjak Cervidae C LC\n3 Burmese Hare Lepus peguensis Leporidae C LC\n4 Malayan Porcupine Hystrix brachyura Hystricidae C LC\n5 White-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus Cervidae C LC\n6 Common Palm Civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus Viverridae C LC\n7 Berdmore's Squirrel Menetes berdmorei Sciuridae C LC\n8 Variable Squirrel Callosciurus finlaysonii Callosciurus C LC\nfinlaysonii\n9 Javan Mongoose Herpestes javanicus Herpestida C LC\ne\n10 Crab-eating Mongoose Herpestes urva Herpestida C LC\ne\nNote: C=Common, LC= Least Concerned\nPhoto 7: Wildlife footprints\nFootprint of Wild Boar Footprint of Red Muntjac\n194.

The other 119 species\nare classified as Least Concern. The development of the 60 MW solar plant will have minimal\nimpact on national populations of the near threatened Blossom-headed Parakeet and Red-\nbreasted Parakeet as their primary habitats are in Northern Cambodia, whilst Oriental Darter\nis only a non-breeding visitor to the site.\n196.

Mean\nnightly activity was 139 bat passes (SD \u00b1 180), with a maximum of 539 passes at SP-13\nand SP-21 and a minimum of 4 bat passes apiece at SP-6, SP-7, SP-10 and SP-11.\n\u2022 Direct observations and interviews with residents did not reveal any significant\n(e.g., >100 individuals) natural roosts for bats. No caves were detected and residents\nconsistently suggested that none occur in the vicinity of the subproject area. The same\nwas true of insectivorous bat farms and flying fox colonies, although occasional\nsightings of flying foxes were reported at SP-4, SP-12, SP-19 and SP-20 which are\npresumed to originate from outside of the subproject area.\n\u2022 With the exception of Hipposideros cf. griffini (which has been proposed as Near-\nThreatened), all bat species directly recorded during the survey are currently\nrecognised as Least Concern by the IUCN (2019). The sightings of flying foxes reported\nby residents are presumed to represent Pteropus vampyrus (Near-Threatened) or P.\nlylei (Vulnerable), because the only other flying fox in Cambodia (P. hypomelanus)\nprimarily occurs in coastal areas and on marine islands.\n\u2022 Regarding its conservation significance, current data suggest that the subproject area\ndoes not qualify for bats under criterion 1 (Habitat of Critically Endangered +/or\nEndangered species), criterion 2 (Habitat of significant importance to endemic and/or\nrestricted-range species) or criterion 3 (Habitat supporting globally significant\nconcentrations of migratory species and/or congregatory species) of IFC Performance\nStandard 6 (IFC 2012a,b)68&69.\nReptile species: Indochinese Spitting Cobra and King Cobra have been reported as present in\nthe area.

Socio-economic study\n199. The objectives of the socio-economic assessment for the Project are to:\n\u00a7 Establish a socio-economic baseline for the project region;\n\u00a7 Identify possible social impacts of project activities on the communities in the\nvicinity of the project area. These may include issues related to land loss, increased\nmigration, women, education, migration, health, economic status and employment;\nand\n\u00a7 Identify suitable avoidance, management and mitigation measures that help\nminimise any adverse effects of the project on local villagers and help maximise\nsocio-economic benefits for the region.\n200. Methodology \u2013 To establish a detailed socio-economic baseline for the project area,\nsocio-economic surveys cover possibly impacted villages, as well as key indirectly impacted\nvillages such as those along the transportation route, i.e. Royas and Chhoun Chet villages. The\nsurvey was based on a standard best practice questionnaire that had been modified by the\nsurvey team to reflect the specific socio-economic context of the project.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 116 ---\n| 35 | Moonlight gourami | Trichohodus\nmicrolepis | Osphronemidae | LC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 36 | Red cheek barb | Puntinus orphoides | Cyprinidae |  |\n| 37 | Lesser silver mud carp | Cirrhinus lobstus | Cyprinidae | LC |\n| 38 | Siamese mud carp | Cirrhinus siamensis | Cyprinidae | LC |\n\nFigure 15: Map of socio-economic survey\nAMLEANG\nCOMMUNE\nPRAC's 60MW\nSOLAR PLANT\nROYAS\nVILLAGE\nPRAMBEI MOM\nCHHEANG LOEURNG\nCOMMUNE\nCOMMUNE\n201. PRAC\u2019s 60 MW Solar Plant is situated within the administrative area of Prey Chrov\nVillage in Kbal Toeuk Commune, where the population is located around 18km to the\nnorthwest (from Solar Plant site to the commune where most people live around) and is\nunlikely to experience any direct or indirect impacts from either the NSP or PRAC\u2019s solar plant.\nTherefore the study team focused on the population centers to the southeast that will\nexperience direct construction transport impacts and may benefit from employment\nopportunities. Population on the main road (i.e. national road no. 52 or 136 from Odong to\nKampong Speu province) is far unlikely to be affected since the Project will not be using the\nroad for any project development purposes.\n202. The study covered three communes \u2013 Kbal Toeuk commune in Toeuk Phos district,\nand Chhean Loerng commune in Samaki Meanchey district, Kampong Chhnang province and\nPrambei Mom commune in Kampong Speu province. Prambei Mom commune was selected\nsince the Project's transportation will be partly through the area of this commune. Only key\ninformant interviews with commune chiefs and village leaders were scheduled and conducted\nin Chhean Loerng and Prambei Mom communes. Given the fact that the Project locates in\nKban Toeuk commune, but there are limited to no human receptors within 2km of the site,\nthe study team had gone beyond the 3km zone to find villagers to consult. The closest human\nreceptors that will be likely to be affected due to transportation are those living along the\nexisting access road (connected from national road no. 52). The study team decided to\nrandomly sample the 78-individual households for the socio-economic survey that was\nconducted in Chhean Loerng commune where the local residents were living on exisitng\naccess road and also close to the Solar Plant (approximately 4-7 km) and are not linked to the\n104\n105\naffected land since the land has been owned fom one person to another before being sold to\nEDC70. Therefore, the socio-economic survey selected samples from Chhoun Chet and Royas\nvillages instead of Prey Chrov village. Based on the commune database, there are 236 families\nand 515 people in Royas village and 80 families and 182 people in Chhoun Chet village. The\ntotal household in Chhean Loeurng commune is 1,212. Sample size was determined based on\nthe current population data using the calculation formula of Yamane Taro (1967) as followed\nwith e=10% and 90% of confidence.\nn = N/1+Ne2\n(n=sample, N=total population, e=sampling error)\nThus, sample for Chhoun Chet village is 60 families and 18 families for Royas village.\n203. Survey collects information required to:\n\u00a7 Determine the age structure, sex ratio and any other relevant demographic\ncharacteristics of the communities within the study area (i.e. mortality rates,\nmarriages, migration and ethnic composition)\n\u00a7 Determine the number of residences, the range and average household size (area\nand number of persons) within the study area\n\u00a7 Describe the level of education and skill of people living in communities within the\nstudy area\n\u00a7 Determine the number of presently employed and unemployed people according\nto gender from each of the villages in the following categories:\n\u00a7 Education level\n\u00a7 Skilled\n\u00a7 Unskilled\n\u00a7 Determine the average and range in household incomes and the proportion of\neffort expended on subsistence versus cash economy activities within the study\narea\n\u00a7 Determine the principal sources of cash income for local people\n\u00a7 Determine the use of and dependence on terrestrial and aquatic resources\n\u00a7 Identify baseline public utilities and services available to local villages\n\u00a7 Identify relevant safety and security issues and risks, such as those associated with\nUXOs\n204. Following completion of the baseline socio-economic study, the ESIA team then\nassessed the potential socio-economic impacts and benefits of the proposed project.\nPotential socio-economic issues were assessed including:\n\u00a7 Impacts on socio-economic, cultural and livelihood activities in the region\n\u00a7 Impacts on migration and future economic growth\n\u00a7 Impacts on land use and land allocation\n\u00a7 Impacts on community social frameworks and local political mechanisms\n\u00a7 Impacts on poverty and development\n\u00a7 Cumulative socio-economic impacts\nPhoto 9: Socio-economic survey\n70 As confirmed by the Touek Phos commune chief in September 2020 during the fieldwork for this ESIA.\n(B) Socio-economic Profile\n205. Demographics: The key informant interviews were conducted in Prambei Mom\ncommune, Thbong District, Kampong Speu province and in Kbal Toeuk Commune, Toek Phos\nDistrict, Kampong Chhnang province but only a 78-household survey was carried out in\nChhean Loerng commune in Royas and Chhoun Chet villages (Figure 16 above). The recent\npopulation data (2019)71 shows that there are 2,745 families in Prambei Mom with a total of\n11,992 people including 5,941 females. There are 329 female-headed families. For Kbal Toek,\nthere are 1,485 families with a total of 9,560 people including 3,177 females and 374 female-\nheaded families. For Chhean Loeurng commune, there are 1,212 families and 2,538 peoples.\nThe average household size across locations is 4-5 persons. There are no other ethnic groups\nthan Khmer in the selected samples and in the study areas.\n206. Education: The survey concluded that 30% of the interviewed residents in the study\nareas completed secondary school and only 5% went to university. Illiteracy is prevalent\namong a certain age group due to schooling limitations during and immediately after the\nKhmer Rouge period which resulted in 15% remained illiterate (Figure 23). Each Commune\nhas several primary schools and one lower secondary school while upper secondary schools\nare located in only Khsem Khsant and Prambei Mom communes. There is one high school in\nPrambei Mom \u2013 Hun Sen An Long Chrey. Also, three secondary schools exist in the areas \u2013\nChrok Tnout Primary-Secondary School, Taing Por Primary School, Prambei Mom Primary\nSchool, and Trapaing Troak Primary School. The 2017 Statistics72 from Ministry of Education,\nYouth and Sports prove that Kampong Chhnang province has grown remarkably both in\neducation quality and quantity. The gross enrollment rate remains high up to 104.6%, 60.3%,\nand 26.7% in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary level. There are 454 educational\nentities (105 pre-schools, 273 primary schools, 60 lower secondary schools, and 16 upper\nsecondary schools) with a total student of 115,302 and 3,510 teachers.\n207. Regarding vocational training, there is no specific data for each commune, but the\nsocio-economic data by the Ministry of Planning in 201673 recorded that there were 160,128\npeoples with age from 18-35 in Kampong Chhnang province, and only 2,466 people have been\non vocational training. Record did not mention exactly what skills were trained and whether\n71 Ministry of Planning (2019). General Population Census of the Kingdom of Cambodia 2019.

Occupation and income: During the field survey in both locations, there were diverse\neconomic activities that generated income for the local residents. Majority of the households\nin the project area practice farming while some households run small businesses. Some\nhousehold members also earn their livelihood working in nearby factories/industries, at\nconstruction sites and/or hold government staff positions. Livelihood generation and\nemployment on plantations was reported as temporary and seasonal. Agriculture is a main\noccupation for both Royas and Chhoun Chet villages with large proportions of respondents\n(55%) involved in farming and cropping. The rest combined as a secondary income generating\nactivities, including livestock, fishery, and worker in factories. Regarding the income, 15% of\nthe interviewed households earns less than 500,000 riel (US$125) annually; while the other\n15% earns the most, more than 3,000,000 riel (US$750). Still poverty is a concern in the survey\narea due to limited job opportunities. The poverty rate in Kampong Chhnang province in 2010\nis only 30.4% and this percentage falls gradually till 2020. Based on the current survey in\nSeptember 2020, the current household poverty rate is around 28% among the interviewed\nhouseholds which was reported by the commune chief. This rate is higher than the national\npoverty line \u2013 12.9% in 2020 74 in Cambodia. Moreover, there is no official record of what\noccupations are for women or men in the study areas. Both males and females are involved\nin similar occupations.\nFigure 17: Occupation and income (Cambodian Riel) of the surveyed households\n74 According to ADB Basic Statistics 2020, the proportion of Cambodians living below the 2018 national poverty line is 12.9%\n(https://www.adb.org/mobile/basic-statistics-2020/).\n108\n109\nPhoto 11: Livelihood activities of the local villagers around the project site\nAnimal raising Vehicle-washing service provision\nFishing Farming and plantation\n209. Energy. In terms of electricity, all interviewed persons reported that they could access\nto electricity at households in the project area. This supply is provided by the Electricity du\nCambodia in Kampong Chhnang province. There is a grid connection around villages. In\naddition, some households could access to private solar panel and batteries for additional\nuses for lighting and household consumption.\n210. For source of energy for cooking, firewood is the most common energy source for\ncooking followed by electricity and liquid petroleum gas. Since the area is plenty of small\nshrubs and re-generated small trees that were good to collecting the firewood. Gas is\ncommonly seen used for cooking in rural Cambodia in combination with firewood.\nFigure 18: Energy Uses\n211. Water use. There are varieties of water sources within the communes. More than half of the\ninterviewed persons collected rainwater for general household uses. It is observed that rainwater\nharvesting materials are built up as an attachment to house structures. Water from stream and well\nand open reservoir are of common uses after rainwater. The Figure below shows similar number of\naccess to these sources. Piped water is also accessible but with a small percentage if compared with\nother sources. Local people use water in different ways. For drinking, rainwater and well are boiled\nbefore drinking. For washing, cleaning, bathing, all sources are interchangeably used depending on\ntheir seasonal availabilities. Regarding sanitation, conditions vary between households. Approximately\nhalf the families have improved toilets (i.e. flush connected to sewerage or septic tank, or pit latrine\nwith slab).\nFigure 19: Water sources and uses\nPhoto 12: Water source and sanitation types\nRainwater jars Piped water\n110\n111\nSanitary toilet Rainwater jars\n212. Land use: The 60 MW solar plant requires 97 ha of land and the site is on a contiguous\npiece of land in Kbal Toek upstream of the An Long Chrey Reservoir.75 There are no\nhabitations/settlements within the proposed site. This site was previously used for cassava\nplantations and was later reportedly abandoned. The site assessment conducted for 197 ha\nidentified the site as mainly scrubland and paddy fields. The site is now a grass-field and a\ngrazing area for local villagers. This is a kind of opportunistic grazing by villagers since the land\nis open and there is no fence to limit their access. There is no permission required to graze in\nthe area unless the cattle does not enter into any privately owned areas (usually it is fenced).\nAround the Project, there are more open areas which can be used for grazing. There is some\nfarmland with sugar cane along the existing access road to the proposed site from Road No.\n52. This existing road will be no use for the project once the new access road is finalized and\nconstructed by the EDC.\n213. Health. The health facilities in the project area are limited. There is one health center\nin Prambei Mom (i.e. An Long Chrey Health Center) and none in Kbal Toeuk. Local villagers\nhave to travel to Kampong Speu province, Kampong Chhnang province, or Phnom Penh for\nserious illnesses. The official record by the Commune Database in 201676, malaria, dengue\nand tuberculosis are presented in Kampong Chhnang province. The death ratio for dengue,\nmalaria, and tuberculosis, among 100,000 people, is 1.3, 1.3, 12.8 for Samakei Meanchey\nDistrict; and 0.0, 0.0, and 13.7 for Toek Phos District. In 2015, in person, there are only 8, 4,\nand 40 people dying from dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis. There is no formal record of\nother diseases but through the interviews with households in September 2020, hypertension,\ndiabetes, intestinal diseses are common among the respondents. Moreover, there are\n132,780 women aging from 15-45 in Kampong Chhnang province and the ration of child birth\namong 1,000 women is 66.1. Almost 100 per cent of these women deliver their babies with\nthe midwives. In 2015, there are 203 midwives in Kampong Chhnang province77.\n214. Local traffic: The national road no. 136 is a main route leading from Odong district to\nthe project site. The traffic pressure on this road is medium since it connects from Odong,\nSamaki Meanchey, Toeuk Phos, and Thbong districts to Kampong Speu province and vice-versa.\nThe road is in good condition and both light and heavy vehicles are commuting around. The\n75 The reservoir serves the micro-hyrdo An Long Chrey project and managed by the Ministry of Water Resources and\nMeteorology (MoWRAM).\n76 Ministry of Planning (2016). Socio-Economic Commune Database: Kampong Chhnang Province, Code: 4. Phnom Penh\n77 Ibid.\ntraffic survey considered the traffic pressure on the existing road that accesses to the project\nsite, and also impacts from project's transportation during the construction especially on the\nsettlements located along the route. Potential accidents or spills of materials were also\nincluded. The primary result showed that the transportation need of the project was minimal\nsince the total planned construction was only 18 months and the needs of transporting\nmaterials in and out of the project site were not a regular basis. The project would require\ncertain schedules to bring in materials and also not for a 24-hour routine. The number of\ntrucks used was limited to around 4-5 trucks per day to avoid the large volume that could\ncause disturbance and accidents over the uses of route of the local villagers. The current traffic\nflow was normal and light since there were no large industrial zones around the project site,\nexcept the Marble Manufacturing Factory that shared the same existing road.\nTable 32: Passenger Car Equivalent (PCE)\nNo. Transportation Mode Passenger Car Equivalent (PCE)\n1 Private car or taxi car 1\n2 12-seat bus 1.5\n3 24-seat bus 1.5\n4 44-seat bus 3\n5 Light transporting truck 3\n6 6-10 wheel transporting truck 3\n7 Horse-drawn vehicles 4.5\n8 3-wheel motorbicycle 1.5\n9 Motobicycle 0.5\n215. The survey showed that road in around the project site had one lane per side and there\nwere only two lanes per road. The suggested carrying-capacity of the road per lane was 2,000\nPCU/h (passenger car units per hour per lane) with a minimum speed of 100km/h. Thus the\ncurrent carrying-capacity of the existing access road around the project site was 4,000 PCU/h.\nAccording to Puopong (1997)78, the traffic low of the road could be described based on the\ntraffic ratios as below:\nTable 33: Traffic Ratio\nNo. Traffic Ratio Traffic Flow\n1 0.88-1.00 Very congested traffic\n2 0.67-0.88 Congested traffic\n3 0.52-067 Medium traffic\n4 0.36-0.52 Light (good) traffic\n5 0.20-0.36 Very light (very good) traffic\n216. The traffic flow was determined through V/C Ration = Traffic Volume/Carrying Capacity\nof Road. Then the survey result for 12 hours (7am-7pm) for the road diverting from national\nroad 136 to the project site showed that the traffic ratio was only 0.002 meaning that there\nwas a very good traffic in the area for both working days and weekend. For national road 136,\nthe traffic ratio recorded only 0.40 due to more vehicles present. Still the traffic flow remained\ngood, with no congestion in general.\n78 Puongpong, N. (1997).

Initial consultations79 with relevant stakeholders potentially affected by the National\nSolar Park project were conducted by EDC\u2018s consultants in May and July 2018 to inform them\nof the proposed project, potential temporary impacts and project benefits. During the\npreparation of this ESIA report for 60MW solar plant, two public consultations at village level\nwere organized by a consultant team of Young Development Research and Consulting Co. Ltd\n(YDRC) on 27 September 2020 to disseminate the 60MW solar plant information and discuss\nthe concerns and suggestions of the potentially affected peoples.\n220. Appendix I of this ESIA includes:\n\u00a7 The agenda for the public consultation meetings\n\u00a7 The Guide Questionnaires for FGDs with women and with men\n\u00a7 The 60MW solar plant's Project Information Booklet (PIB) in Khmer that distributed to\nparticipants in the meetings\n\u00a7 Photo documentation of the consultations\n\u00a7 Attendance sheets with signatures\n5.2 Consultations \u2013 60MW Solar Plant\n221. The second set of consultations covered participants (villagers) from a total of 3\nvillages in 2 communes (Figure 20) in the vicinity of the proposed the 60 MW solar plant\nKampong Chhnang province. Total of 26 persons (11 females) participated in the FGDs at the\nvillage level. The first consultation was organized on 27 September 2020 in Royas village with\nlocal residents from Royas and Chhoun Chet villages. The second village consultation was held\nin Trapaing Troak village, Prambei Mom commune, Thbong district, Kampong Speu province,\nwhere the future access road to be built by EDC is planned. The COVID-19 precautionary\nmeasures were strictly applied with all participants during the consultation. Temperature-\nchecking, face masks, and hand-cleaning gel or alcohol spray were set up and required for\nevery participant prior to the discussion.\n79 Consultations for the solar park were held as follows \u2013 4 at village level. Out of 4 villages, only one village called Trapeang\nTroak was covered twice for consultations (i.e. solar park).\nFigure 20: Location map of village consultations\nChhean\nLoeurng\nCommune\nPrambei Mom\nCommune\n222. Consultations with the affected persons includes information on the project\nenvironmental impacts (positive and negative), safeguards measures including community\nhealth and safety, training in emergency response, project implementation schedule and\nprocess, results from environmental baseline surveys, and acquisition and compensation\nprocess, affected households, affected persons\u2019 right to complain and Project GRM.\nConsultations with affected persons provides a two-way information sharing channel,\nensuring that the concerns, questions and ideas of the affected persons were discussed and\nresponded to in an appropriate and gender inclusive way.\n(A) Village consultation in Royas Village, Chhean Loueng Commune, Samaki Meanchey\nDistrict, Kampong Chhnang Province\n223. The consultative meeting started at 8:30am with the primary introduction of the team\nand the project. The project size is 97 ha and locates in Kbal Toeuk village, Chhean Loueng\nCommune, but the existing access route is from Tbong District, Kampong Speu province. The\nproject will be under the construction and operation of the PRAC that is granted the rights to\ndevelop the project the period of 20 years in the scheme of BOO. The construction will take\nup to 18 months and there will be solar plant, water ponds, guard post, and fence.\n224. The predicted social and environmental impacts are listed in the table in the booklet\ngiven to individual participants. The impacts range from soil erosion to social culture\ndisturbance. The significance of the impacts is averagely low in all project phases (pre-\nconstruction, construction, operation). Mitigations to these impacts are given for some\nexamples to let participants clear with what will happen and how it will be managed.\n116\n117\n225. The project is under the safeguard conditions of ADB and performance standards of\nIFC and the environmental laws and regulations of Cambodia. Impact assessment is required\nto enable the project to manage anticipated impacts. The presentation also highlighted the\nPRAC's grievance mechanism that participants could exercise in case they were not happy with\nthe project's treatment or if they wanted to complain for any unprecedented impacts.\n226. Participants were allowed to provide comments and feedback on the presentation.\nFew people turned in with some concerns and suggestions.\n\u2022 Participant 1: Since the project will use this road for the transportation, please drive\nthe vehicles safely, and avoid certain time (sleeping or school times) to not disturb the\npeople and their local economic activities.\n\u2022 Participant 2: If the project needs some labor, please consider selecting us in the local\nvillage so that we can get a job and some little income.\n\u2022 Participant 3: The project must consult with villagers in advance if they place the\ntransmission poles and pay a proper compensation.\n\u2022 Participant 4: The project has no big concern for us. We do not own any land there.\n227. In response, YDRC confirmed that the impacts were associated with the project\nactivities of the solar plant only. Transmission line is a shared facility but not included in the\nscope of impact assessment for the solar plant. There was a separate assessment already\nundertaken for such facility.\nPhoto 15: Village consultation in Royes Village, Chhean Loeung Commune\n(B) Village consultation in Trapaing Trok Village, PramBei Mom Commune, Thbong District,\nKampong Speu Province\n228. The consultative meeting started at 3:30pm with the primary introduction of the\nproject. The project size is 97 ha and locates in Kbal Toeuk village, Chhean Loueng Commune,\nbut the existing access route is from Tbong District, Kampong Speu province. The project will\nbe under the construction and operation of the PRAC that is granted the rights to develop the\nproject the period of 20 years in the scheme of BOO. The construction will take up to 18\nmonths and there will be 60 MW solar plant, access route, water ponds, guard post, and fence.\n229. Participants were given the same project information as did in the consultation with\nthe villagers in Chhean Loerng commune.\n230. Participants were allowed to provide comments and feedback on the presentation.\nFew people turned in with some concerns and suggestions.\n\u2022 Participant 1: We do not concern much about the project impacts since it is Toeuk Phos\ndistrict. What I concern is the placing the transmission poles to GS6. Just inform us and\npay us the compensation before the project starts.\n\u2022 Participant 2: The access road is cutting through the private land and plantation. The\nproject must consult with the owners and address the land prices prior to building the\nroute.\n\u2022 Participant 3: We are happy to see the project and expect of job employment for our\nlocal villagers.\n231. In response, the consultation confirmed that the impacts were associated with the\nproject activities of the solar plant only. Transimssion line is a shared facility but not included\nin the scope of impact assessment for the solar plant. There is a separated assessment for\nsuch facility. Participants were informed that prior to placing the transmission poles, EDC will\ncomplete the compensation with informed consent from affected households. All concerns\nand impacts will be addressed in the Resettlement Action Plan of EDC\u2019s NSP. Similar treatment\nwill be conducted for the access road. Any associated impacts will be recorded and addressed\nprior to any road construction. For employment, the project will require local labor to help\nconstruct the project and this will give the opportunity to local villagers to be employed. The\nsub-contractor will develop its own employment plan for PRAC.\nPhoto 16: Village consultation in Trapaing Troak Village, Prambei Mum commune\n118\n119\nVillage consultation in Trapaing Troak village, PramBei Mom commune, Thbong district\n(C) Consultative meeting with PramBei Mom Commune Chief, Thpong District, Kampong\nSpeu Province\n\u2022 Because the project locates in Toeuk Phos district, there is no land conflict on the local\npeople in the commune, but I would like to request for appropriate resolutions if there\nare conflicts occurred.\n\u2022 I would also request for a proper caution in regard of traffic and public safety, especially\ntraffic accidents resulting from transporting materials and workers during the project\ndevelopment phases.\n\u2022 I suggest that prior to placing the transmission poles from the project, the project\nowner must consult with local authorities and the affected villagers to avoid or\nminimize land conflicts on private properties of the local villagers.\n\u2022 I support the project.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 132 ---\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n\n--- Table on Page 132 ---\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n232. In response, the consultant team informed that the PRAC built only the solar plant.\nThe assessment conducted this time was to capture concerns and suggestions of the relevant\npeoples and stakeholders about the 60 MW solar plant \u2013 constructing and installing the PV\npanel only.\n(D) Consultative meeting with Chhean Loueng Commune Chief, Toeuk Phos District,\nKampong Chhnang Province\n\u2022 Since the past this area belongs to private individuals and then they sold them to\nMother Barang (local nickname) who bought all land in the area for cassava plantation\nand later the area is abandoned due to low productivity.\n\u2022 The project site locates further away from the villages (Royas, Chhoun Chet) and the\nareas are privately owned. As EDC already purchased the land from owners, then there\nwill be no serious land conflicts.\n\u2022 I think the project activities will not cause any risks or damages on forest and wildlife\nresources because there are less of such resources and it is the former farmland.\n\u2022 I suggest the project owner (1) comply with regulations especially the regulations on\ntransporting materials and staff in and out of the site that would disturb or affect the\nlocal villagers living along the road; and (2) cooperate with local authorities for every\nactivity.\n(E) Consultative meeting with Mr. Soth Sang, Deputy-District Governor of Toeuk Phos (22\nSeptember 2020)\n\u2022 The project owner must consult with local authorities and villagers in advance before\nthe start of the project work and must ensure that there will be no conflicts on the\nright of way in front of their houses.\n\u2022 The project owner must show the master plan and design of the project facilities and\nlocations so that people are aware of the project and are ready to cooperate in case\nof there are conflicts or impacts from the project.\n\u2022 I am very much happy with the development project because there is no sufficient\npower in Cambodia yet.\n\u2022 I request for a safe transportation of materials and staff in and out of the project site\nthat would cause traffic accidents unintentionally. Drivers must be trained and driving\nmust be monitored regularly to minimize the impacts.\n\u2022 The project must not fill the cracks, canals, or streams within and closed to the project\nsite to avoid flood in the raining season. The project must prepare the drainage system\nto avoid flood and drain the wastewater from the project site.\n\u2022 I think this project has no severe concerns on the environmental and social resources\nand the local villagers.\n(F) Provincial consultation\nYDRC organized a consultative meeting on 19 October 2020 with relevant departments in\nKampong Chhnang province. Mr. Khem Channorn, deputy-director of provincial\nadministration chaired the consultation since the deputy-governor was busy accompanying\nthe provincial governor for the flooding relief work. The consultation meeting followed the\n120\n121\nagenda: (1) introduction to all participants, (2) remark by the chair, (3) project and ESIA\npresentation, (4) questions and answers (including feedback), and (5) wrap up and closure.\nThere were 20 participants from provincial departments and local NGO (Build Community\nVoice) (list of attendence is attached in the Appendix VI).\nMr. Khem Channorn \u2013 Deputy-Director\n\u2022 It is a great pleasure to welcome the project since Kampong Chhnang province was\nvery attractive to many development projects.\n\u2022 This is not the only one solar plant. In this province there are some others including\nthe one in Taing Krasaing commune.\n\u2022 The solar plant is good to produce more energy and this energy is renewable. This\nmeans that we can generate electricity for a long time since the sun never runs out of\nits energy. This project can produce up to 60 MW and hope that this energy will help\nreduce our power scarcity and reliance on fuel source.\n\u2022 We meet to today to welcome the project and learn about it and provide our inputs or\ncomments to assure that the project minimizes the risks as predicted and brings more\nbenefits than losses to our communities and Cambodia as a whole.\n\u2022 I would like to invite all of you to look through the presentation and materials provided\nin this meeting and bring about the concerns and suggestions so that we develop the\nproject in a manner that is environmentally friendly and sound.\nThe consultant team of YDRC presents the project information and the ESIA findings to all\nparticipants.\nMr. Van Rady, inter-sectoral officer of provincial office\n\u2022 I fully support the project. I would request that if all land plots are not yet properly\npurchased, please procedure with the buying-and-selling principles to assure it legality.\n\u2022 I suggest having all plots combined into one-single tenure and registered with Land\nDepartment in the province.\nMr. Saing Sokhern \u2013 Deputy-governor of Toeuk Phos district\n\u2022 There is no route from Toeuk Phos to the project site. Thus the project has to go\nthrough the national road no. 136 in Chhean Loeung commune. As far as I know, this\nproject closes to Kiri Aphivat village, which is a newly-established village in that area,\nwhich borders with Toeuk Phos and Samaki Meanchey districts, and also closed to the\nTbeng Srorng community forestry. Most disturbed people are from this new village I\nthink. Therefore the project may need to build new road through Samaki Meanchey\ndistrict. My request is to help build such road in this district for not only the benefit of\nthe project, but also local people enjoy traveling around too. This road is about 4\nkilometers.\n\u2022 Because it is a government supported project, I totally support it.\nMr. Bong Bonny \u2013 Deputy-Director of Cults Department\n\u2022 There is no impact on any sacred site as there is none of these in and around the\nproject site.\n\u2022 I fully support the project.\nMs. Phin Phalla \u2013 Deputy-Director of Women Affairs Department\n\u2022 Transportation of materials and staff or workers must lower the risks of dust and\nminimizes the traffic accidents. Please water the road regularly to keep dust down\nwhere dust is potentially generated.\n\u2022 Local people are not using the road properly. Please ask your driver to be more\nmoderate and professional in driving i.e. with speed limits. Also the project shall\ninform the local authority and people of the transportation schedule so that they could\nmanage themselves to avoid any road challenges.\nMr. Nou Sokhon \u2013 Deputy-Director of MLV Department\n\u2022 What is the labor required for this project during the construction phase? How many\nCambodians and foreigners?\n\u2022 I would suggest the project implement the safety measures for all workers and staff in\nthis project. Also please prepare the workbook of all staff and workers and inform the\nMLV department prior to your groundwork.\nMr. Ouk Sophea \u2013 Deputy-Chief of Office of Transport and Public Work Department\n\u2022 I support the project and the project is just aware of heavy transport to avoid road\npressure and damages.\n\u2022 In case of heavy transport, please consult with the Department prior to any work.\nMr. Saing Sokhern \u2013 Deputy-Cheif of Toeuk Phos District\n\u2022 I suggest the project inform us as local authority at least one week prior to any\ngroundwork so that I can arrange local guard and people to accompany to avoid any\nunplanned conflicts.\n\u2022 Also please keep the local authorities alerted and informed of any work of the project\nMr. Khem Channorn \u2013 Deputy-Director of Administration\n\u2022 I would also request all participants here bring up your concerns and suggestions\nbased on your individual areas of work and expertises. Or you can mention if it is not\nmuch relevant with you. Here is my summary of the meeting:\n\u2022 (1) I support the suggestions from Agriculture Department, as to combine all land plots\ninto one and register with Land Department. Also please alert the local authorities\nwhen the project starts working on the ground to avoid any unprecended conflicts with\nthe local people.\n\u2022 (2) I support the comments from Land Department to change the land use status from\nagriculture to residential/industrial and request the project to get the application\napproved for site boundary.\n\u2022 (3) I support the feedback from Women Affairs Department to water the road where\nthere is a potential dust generation, and to inform the local authority of the\ntransportation schedule.\n\u2022 (4) Toeuk Phos deputy-governor requests for a new road (4km in length) as a\ncontribution to the communities, and the project.\n\u2022 (5) The project employs the local residents for the project to increase economic\nactivities and incomes of the local people to reduce the out-migration of the people.\n\u2022 (6) Department of Planning agrees with project as there is no resident on site.\n122\n123\n\u2022 (7) On behalf of the provincial authority, I confidentially support this project and\nrequest the project inform the authority of every development stages of the project. I\nrequest all relevant departments provide support as needed to keep the project going\nsmoothly and effectively.\n233. Overall responses: PRAC is contracted to build the 60MW Solar Plant within the EDC's\nNational Solar Park Project. The project information was already given in 60MW\u2019s PIB and\npresented in Slide and drafted ESIA report to everyone in the meeting today. PRAC builds,\noperates and transfers the project after 20 years. Assessments and studies will be separately\nconducted for other facilities. The consultation today is to inform you all about the Solar Plant\nand its plans/schedules to complete it development plan. PRAC will need to recruit local staff\nand workers and this will be done through local notices in the nearby villages and communes.\nPhoto 17: Provincial consultation on 19 October 2020\n5.3 Information disclosure\n234. Project Information Books (PIB) for 60MW Solar Plant provides meaningful\ninformation sharing, consultations and active participation of concerned stakeholders. The\nintention of this PIB is to prevent misconceptions on project impacts, project implementation\nprocess and doubts or misconceptions on the project that may cause delays in project\nimplementation.\n235. As above, the consultant team has recorded all information dissemination and\nconsultation activities and the results from consultations with the affected persons, including\nhow concerns raised and recommendations made are addressed in the ESIA and ESMP for the\n60MW Solar Plant.\n236. Consultations with concerned stakeholders will continue throughout project\nimplementation and will be open and gender inclusive.\n237. The ESIA for 60MW Solar Plant will be disclosed on ADB website (www.adb.org) in\ncompliance with the ADB SPS 2009 and Access to Information Policy 2018. An updated\nPIB/FAQ in Khmer were made available for the affected communities in public consultation\nmeetings, project construction field offices and commune offices.\n5.4 Grievance redress mechanism\n5.4.1 Awareness of Stakeholders\n238. Initial consultations with relevant stakeholders potentially affected by the project were\nconducted in May and July 2018 by EDC\u2019s NSP IEE consultants before the commencement of\nany project activity to inform them of the proposed project, potential temporary impacts and\nproject benefits. Two village consultations were held on 27 September 2020 by YRDC to\ndisseminate information about this 60 MW solar plant project and to discuss the concerns and\nsuggestions of potentially affected peoples.\n239. A PIB containing preliminary information on GRM for 60MW solar plant was made\navailable at the time of the initial consultations\n5.4.2 Need for Grievance Redress Mechanism\n240. Since this project is funded by ADB and IFC and requires PRAC to establish a project\nspecific GRM for 60MW Solar Plant to provide an accessible platform for receiving and\nfacilitating resolution of complaints from affected persons on project implementation. GRM\nwill cover issues that may be raised on environmental issues such as temporary increase in\ndust, noise or traffic causing inconvenience to local people, access to adjacent\nproperties/agricultural land or other relevant issues.\n5.4.3 Current Scenario\n241. The SECU of PMO (PRAC) is aware of the procedures of handling complaints/grievance\nattributed to social or environmental issues based on several discussions and meetings with\nADB/IFC. SECU (PRAC) will proactively engage with affected persons and other relevant\nstakeholders via a project community awareness program prior to start of civil works. The\nprogram will cover the scope of the project, schedule of construction activities, identified\nimpacts and mitigation measures, health and safety issues and GRM. There will be ongoing\npublic consultation during project implementation as described in the ESMP.\n5.4.4 Project GRM\n242. Composition. Unless otherwise directed by EDC, PRAC will set up a Grievance Redress\nCommittee (GRC) as soon as the project commences. PRAC understands that EDC may require\nit to participate in the GRM for the NSP and this section will therefore be redundant. The NSP\nGRM and the PRAC GRC, if required, would function from construction commencement and\nthroughout the operations phase. The GRC will include the relevant local commune and/or\nvillage chiefs. It will be headed by the PMO of PRAC through the duration of the project life.\n124\n125\nOther members may include Provincial Officer or their nominee, District Officer from the\nCadastral office or their nominee, Contractor and a witness of the affected person; at least\none person in the GRC will be female.\n243. Responsibilities. The GRC is expected to: (i) resolve issues on land acquisition (if any),\n(ii) resolve issues on dust, noise, vibration, construction related nuisances to public, etc.; (iii)\nconvene once a month to review complaints lodged (if any); (iv) record the grievances and\nresolve the issues within 30 days from the date the grievance was filed with the SECU; and (v)\nreport to the complainant(s)/affected persons the status of grievance resolution and the\ndecisions made or action taken.\n244. Area of Jurisdiction. GRC will be established at provincial level (\u201cProvincial GRC\u201d) with\nrepresentation from commune councils across the project area of influence where the project\ncomponents will be implemented.\n245. Procedures. The key contacts for the GRC will be posted at construction sites,\nconstruction camps and public notice boards in affected communes in Khmer language. The\nGRM will consist of the following steps of conflict resolution:\n\u00a7 Step 1 \u2013 Any complaints by an affected person/complainant can be presented to the\ncommune council via village or commune chief, either verbally in person or in\nwriting.80 The village or commune chief will be obliged to provide immediate written\nreceipt of the complaint and take it forward in a written format and shared with the\nSECU of PRAC.81 The SECU will resolve the issue within one week through negotiation.\nThe SECU will maintain records of complaint received and/or resolutions and submit it\nto PMO as part of their monthly progress reports.\n\u00a7 Step 2 \u2013 If or when the affected person/complainant is not satisfied with the action or\ndecision of the contractor, an affected person/complainant will take the issue to\nPMO/PRAC via the commune council. In all cases, the grievances will be recorded in\nwriting and then forwarded to the SECU of PRAC. PRAC will have 15 days to resolve the\ncomplaint through negotiation. If the issue is not handled within 15 days, or if the\ncomplainant is not satisfied with the result, he/she can bring the issue to the District\noffice.\n\u00a7 Step 3 \u2013 The District office has 15 days to negotiate the complaint and bring it into a\nresolution. If the complaint cannot be resolved in a way that is satisfactory to all parties,\nthe District office will bring the issue to the provincial GRC.\n\u00a7 Step 4 \u2013 The Provincial GRC will meet the affected person/complainant and try to\nresolve the issue. Within 30 days of the submission of the complaint to the GRC, it has\nto take a decision and inform in written both the affected person/complainant and\nSECU/PRAC of the decision.\n80 If affected persons do not have sufficient writing skills or are unable to express their grievances verbally, it is a common\npractice that they are allowed to seek assistance from any recognized local NGO or other family members, village heads\nor community chiefs to have their complaints or grievances written for them. affected persons will be allowed to have\naccess to the Detail measurement survey or contract document to ensure that all the details have been recorded\naccurately enabling all parties to be treated fairly. Throughout the grievance redress process, the responsible committee\nwill ensure that the concerned affected persons are provided with copies of complaints and decisions or resolutions\nreached.\n81 Each contractor will designate a contractor GRM focal person (C-GRM)\n\u00a7 Step 5 \u2013 If the affected person/complainant gets no response from the Provincial GRC\nor is not satisfied with the result, he/she can bring the case to the Provincial Court.\nThe Court will make a written decision and submit copies to the executing and\nimplementing agencies. If any party is still unsatisfied with the Provincial Court\njudgment, he/she can bring the case to a higher-level court.\n\u00a7 Step 6 \u2013 If efforts to resolve disputes using the grievance procedures remain\nunresolved or unsatisfactory, affected persons have the right to directly discuss their\nconcerns or problems with the ADB\u2019s Energy Division, Southeast Asia Department or\nthrough the ADB Cambodia Resident Mission (CARM) and IFC\u2019s ombudsman office. If\naffected persons are still not satisfied with the responses of the Division and/or CARM,\nthey can directly contact the ADB Office of the Special Project Facilitator through the\naccountability mechanism82.\n246. Recordkeeping and Reporting. SECU of PRAC will keep a record of all the grievances\nreceived, including contact details of complainant, date the complaint was received, nature of\ngrievance, agreed corrective actions and the date these were affected, and final outcome.\nDocumentation of the grievances filed and resolved will be summarized and reported in\nquarterly project progress reports and semi-annual safeguard reports.\n247. Disclosure of Information. Under the direction of the PMO, the SECU will inform the\naffected persons/complainants on grievance redress procedure, who to contact and when,\nwhere and how to file a grievance, time likely to be taken for redressal of minor and major\ngrievances, etc. Grievances received and responses provided will be documented and\nprovided to the affected persons during the process. The number of grievances recorded and\nresolved and the outcomes will be displayed/disclosed in the project field offices and\nCommune council offices and Provisional Office (if required).\n248. Review of the Process. The SECU of PRAC will periodically review the implementation\nof the GRM and record information on the effectiveness of the mechanism, especially on the\nproject\u2018s ability to prevent and address grievances.\n249. Cost of Implementation. Costs involved in resolving the complaints (meetings,\nconsultations, communication and reporting/information dissemination) will be borne by\nPRAC.\n82 https://www.adb.org/site/accountability-mechanism/main\n126\n127\nCHAPTER 6: ANTICIPATED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS\nAND MITIGATION MEASURES\n6.1 Impact Assessment\n6.1.1 Impact identification\n250. The study identified the impacts using three distinct methods: (i) checklist as required\nby the Ministry of Environment as endorsed in 2009, (ii) matrix table assessing impacts against\nproject activities that potentially affect natural and socio-economic resources, and (iii)\noverlaying method using ArcGIS. The information for overlaying was needed from existing and\nfieldwork data (project and facility locations, residential/household locations, main\ninfrastructures on site, and critical sensitive receptors).\n6.1.2 Impact significance assessment\n(A) Impact significance\n251. This is done based on three levels of significance (a) Low, (b) Moderate, (c) High in\naccording to each parameter in quantity and quality formats (if quantification is possible). The\nanalysis of the level of impact significance is discussed based on four main criteria as\nillustrated below:\n\u00a7 Spatial scale examines how much or far the impacts cover\n\u00a7 Temporal scale identifies the duration of the impacts that can stay in the\nenvironment\n\u00a7 Magnitude of change/effect scale identifies the measures of scale of benefit/dis-\nbenefit of an impact or a condition\n\u00a7 Reversibility scale defines whether the condition can be changed and is a measure\nof the control over the effect of the condition\nSpatial scale\nReversibility/\nTemporal Scale\nIntensity Scale\nMagnitude of\nChange/Effect\nFigure 21: Four criteria for assessing the significance of the impact\n(B) Procedures for assessing the impacts\n252. Assessing the impacts considers the \u201clivelihood\u201d and possibility of negative and\npositive impacts and their consequences from project implementation. Waste risks were\ndetermined and mitigations were proposed to minimize and manage them. Key impact\n\n\n--- Table on Page 140 ---\n| CHAPTER 6: ANTICIPATED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS |\n| --- |\n| AND MITIGATION MEASURES |\n\nassessment procedures follow the following steps:\n\u00a7 Step 1: Through consultation with experts and local communities, impacts could be\nidentified and assessed based on the four criteria above. These criteria ensured the\nappropriateness and accuracy of the assessment methods. Score was given 1, 2, or 3\nfor each impact based on the information and data collected from the fieldwork and\nthe project information, and the field parameter testing (i.e. from certified\nlaboratories in Cambodia).\n\u00a7 Step 2: Estimate and calculate the scores given to identify the level of key impact\nsignificance, i.e. low, moderate or high.\n\u00a7 Step 3: Impact significance were further assessed against the \u201cLivelihood\u201d criteria\nwhich includes four levels \u2013 not likely happen, possibly happen, surely happen, and\nwill happen. Form this step, impact is finally rated as low, moderate or high again.\n\u00a7 Step 4: Impact significance of the whole project was assessed in form of percentage to\nassure how much impact significance is foreseen as low, moderate or high. Through\nthese steps, impacts are carefully screened and assessed with proven evidence and\ndiscussions.\n(C) Determining the mitigation measures\n\u00a7 Avoidance: Avoiding impacts by modifying the design, process, location, footprint of\nthe project through an iterative process in order to prevent or limit a possible impact.\n\u00a7 Minimization: Minimizing impacts by implementing decisions or activities that are\ndesigned to reduce the undesirable impacts of a proposed activity on the surrounding\nenvironment, including measures such as reducing the activity footprint,\nimplementing emissions reduction technology, etc.\n\u00a7 Rectification: Continued monitoring to ensure measures continue to be effective at\npreventing impact and progressively rehabilitating/restoring affected environment.\nThis would include attempts at habitat re-creation, to restore the original pre-mining\nland uses and biodiversity values.\n\u00a7 Compensation: Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute\nresources or environment\n(D) Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for 60MW Solar Plant\n253. The ESMP covers both the construction, operations and decommission phase of the\nproject. For all the environmental and social risks and potential impacts identified in the ESIA,\nmanagement measures are recommended in the ESMP to prevent, minimize or offset these\nimpacts.\n254. A preliminary budget and work plan for the management and monitoring activities are\nincluded in the ESMP. PRAC agrees with the Royal Government of Cambodia regarding the\nfinal budget for the ESMP implementation, and the Social and Environmental Fund.\n(E) Contents of ESMP\n255. As per Annex 1 of the MoE's Declaration on General Guideline for Developing IEIA/EIA\nReport (2009) the contents of the ESMP covers the following:\n\u00a7 Summary of negative impacts and reduction measures;\n\u00a7 Training program\n128\n129\n\u00a7 Environmental Monitoring Program for project construction phase, project operation\nphase and project decommission phase, in which the project owner must state:\n\u00a7 Monitoring agency for the project monitoring\n\u00a7 Monitoring parameters\n\u00a7 Methodology for monitoring\n\u00a7 Environmental standards and guideline used for monitoring\n\u00a7 Program and cycle for monitoring\n\u00a7 Assessment of result of monitoring by project owner\n\u00a7 Quarterly reports to submit to Ministry of Environment and one monitoring report to\nthe Lenders during construction and annual report in the later stages to the Lenders.\n(F) Social and environmental fund\n256. The project allocates some fund as required by the MoE's 1999 Sub-decree on IEIA/EIA\nfor the sake of protecting and rehabilitating the associated damages the project will cause.\nPRAC will be responsible for allocating the fund in consultation with MoE during the\npreparation for Environmental Contract before the agreement on ESIA report is approved.\n6.2 Project Environmental Benefits\n257. This project is expected to have significant environmental benefits. A transition to\nclean solar energy generation will limit import dependence on coal and other fossil fuels, delay\nor defer construction of new coal-fired plants and reduce reliance on hydropower\ngeneration83. This would contribute to national emission reduction targets84 and reduced\npollution impacts. A 60 MW project will avoid approximately 84,000 tons of carbon dioxide-\nequivalent (tCO2e) annually over a 20-year project lifetime.\n6.3 Environmental Impact Screening\n258. This section discusses potential environmental impacts in the context of the following\nfactors:\n\u00a7 \u201cReceptor\u201d: the resource (human/natural environment/economic/social) that is\npotentially going to receive and have to cope with an impact.\n\u00a7 \u201cSensitivity\u201d: ability to cope with an impact and/or its importance to Cambodia. It\nis generally accepted that human health is always a high sensitivity receptor,\nhowever in terms of environmental/natural resources, the sensitivity varies\naccording to the receptor e.g. scrubland with no significant biodiversity is\nconsidered less sensitive than a water body which may support aquatic\necosystems or the local biodiversity or livelihoods through fishing and/or tourism.\n\u00a7 \u201cMagnitude\u201d: the size of the potential impact. Impacts may be short term and\nconsidered low magnitude (e.g. noise, dust or vibration) or high magnitude and\nlong term (e.g. global and regional flyways of migratory birds).\n259. Where an impact may occur, if there is no receptor to potentially receive the impact,\n83 Cambodia now has a surplus of power generation in some hours in wet periods and at nighttime. Yet the national grid is\nunable to meet daytime peak demand in high population areas such as Phnom Penh and experiences shortages during the\ndry season when storage in hydropower reservoirs is limited.\n84 https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/khmnc2.pdf\nthen mitigating actions are not required. This follows the source-pathway-receptor model,\nwhereby in order for there to be an impact, the pollutant or issue (source) needs to be present,\nthe pathway to a receptor is needed (such as water for human consumption) and a receptor\nmust be present to receive the impact, such as humans, flora or fauna.\n260. Environmental impacts were assessed across all stages of project implementation i.e.\n(i) design and pre-construction stage, (ii) construction stage, and (iii) operation stage. Potential\ncumulative and induced impacts from further planned development of the project and other\nsources of similar impacts were also considered.\n6.4 Pre-Construction Stage\n261. The potential adverse environmental impacts associated with the project are avoided\nor minimized by: (i) careful site selection and route alignment by EDC for the NSP and its\nassociated infrastructure; (ii) PRAC integrating key measures that will permanently become\npart of its plant through inclusion in the project detailed engineering design; (iii)\nimplementation of environmental mitigation measures for identified impacts; and (iv)\nensuring project environment management readiness.85 These are as follows:\n6.4.1 Site and Route Selection.\n262. A critical issue for the management of impacts on identified receptors, particularly: a)\nhouseholds areas/structures, b) surface water sources, c) groundwater wells, d) road and\nrailway crossings, e) global and regional flyways of migratory birds, f) protected areas, habitats\nand species of conservation value, and g) physical cultural resources (PCRs).\n263. EDC and ADB undertook a Pre-Feasibility Study86 to assess site and route options for\nthe NSP project. The preferred NSP site and route were selected to avoid sensitive receptors\nsuch as protected areas, habitats and species of conservation value, hospitals/clinics/schools,\nPCRs as well as to minimize impacts on human health, households, crops and trees of\neconomic value.\n6.4.2 Land Requirements\n264. Land purchase. The PRAC\u2019s 60 MW solar plant will be constructed on 97 ha of land\nleased from EDC, which purchased the land from owners through a negotiated process at\nmartket rates and on a willing seller willing buyer basis. EDC has informed Council for\nDevelopment of Cambodia (CDC) about the progress of the land aquisition in a letter dated\non 27 October 2020. For the 60 MW Solar Plant, the 27 land plots (combining together to get\n102 ha) have been already purchased and being procedured to transfer ownership rights from\nbuyers (i.e. villagers) to EDC. The purchase has been conducted with the villagers on a willing-\nto-sell-buy basis with contracts and agreements prior to the payment.\n265. In September 2020, EDC commissioned an external independent expert. A local law\nfirm undertook a review of the procurement process for the solar plant land (phase 1 of\n85 Project design is discussed in detail in the project Feasibility Study while Climate Risks and Vulnerability Analysis is enclosed\nas Appendix IV.\n86 National Solar Park Project for Cambodia: Pre-Feasibility Study, August 2017\n130\n\n\n--- Table on Page 143 ---\n|  | Land purchase.

The third part assessment report87 (September\n2020) concludes that:\n- The land is partly owned by a company and partly owned by individuals.\n- The land acquired by EDC does not adversely impact the business or livelihoods of\nsellers or their families. The landowners are not identified as vulnerable or have land\nbased livelihoods.\n- No land plots have residential or commercial properties on the land.\n- It is reported that the affected persons expressed satisfaction withe provided rates,\nand that the land acquired is free from any encumbrances (including encroachment,\nsquatters etc.) and outstanding comlaints.\n- It is verified that the landowners willingly agreed to sell the land plots and the price\nfor affected land and assets were negotiated with the affected persons without\ncoercion.\n266. There is no temporary land aquisition associated with the solar plant; all civil works\nwill be undertaken within the solar plant acquired area.\n6.4.3 Training and Capacity Building\n267. Training and Capacity Building.88 The capacity of PRAC PMO and its contractors\nresponsible for ESMP implementation, GRM and supervision will be strengthened. The\ncapacities of PMO of PRAC and contractors to coordinate environmental management will be\nstrengthened through a set of measures:\n\u00a7 Appointment of at least one environment focal person and one social focal person\nwithin the PMO to be in charge of ESMP coordination, implementation and site\ninspections including project GRM\n\u00a7 Appointment of at least one environment, health and safety officer (\u201cC-EHS\u201d) within\nthe contractor staff to be in charge of ESMP coordination, implementation, site\ninspections and information disclosure and consultations\n\u00a7 Appointment of at least one GRM focal person (\u201cC-GRM\u201d) to be in charge of project\nGRM coordination, handling complaints, dispute resolution, site visits and\ninformation disclosure and consultations\n268. PRAC PMO will provide training on ESMP implementation, supervision, monitoring and\nreporting, project GRM, conducting meaningful consultations and relevant environmental\nrules and regulation. In addition, orientation and briefing of project staff, all contractors/sub-\ncontractors, hired workers will be conducted prior to mobilization on site during construction\nand operation stages.\n269. Mitigation measures defined in this ESIA and ESMP are based on final detailed\nengineering design. Site-specific checklists are developed in ESMP to use in monitoring\nenvironmental compliance during construction and operation.\n87 The third part assessment report considers land aquisition for 130.92 hectares which covers the Project (60MW Solar PV\nProject) land requirements, Phase 2 (40MW Solar PV Project) land requirements, and land required for the construction\nworks (fencing, roads, and drainage systems) and shared facilities within the solar park.\n88 Also see Section 9, Environmental Management Plan.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 144 ---\n| National Solar Park), which determined that negotiations were free, fair, transparent and did |\n| --- |\n| not cause involuntary displacement impacts. The third part assessment report87 (September |\n| 2020) concludes that: |\n\n\n\n--- Table on Page 144 ---\n| The land is partly owned by a company and partly owned by individuals. |\n| --- |\n| The land acquired by EDC does not adversely impact the business or livelihoods of |\n| sellers or their families.

Impacts on land, vegetation,\nair, water, waste or physical resources have been detected in association with the Project's\nactivities and presences of workers, staff and contractors. The identified environmental and\nsocial impacts are detailed in the following section. The immediate description (A-B-C-D) is\nthe PRAC's overall plan to manage staff, contractors and workers to avoid any unprecendeted\nimpacts from their stay during the construction stage.\n(A) Orientation for Project Staff, Contractors, Workers\n270. Prior to mobilizing on site, the SECU and PMO of PRAC will conduct briefing and\norientation for all project staff and tumkey contractors/sub-contractors. Engineering,\nProcurement, and construction (EPC), and Project Implementation Consultant (PIC) of EDC\u2019s\nNational Solar Park will invited to observe the orientation. The following information will be\ndisseminated :\n\u00a7 ESMP, GRM, Information disclosure and meaningful consultation, environmental\nmonitoring and reporting requirements\n\u00a7 ADB/IFC and Cambodia labor standards\n\u00a7 Responsibilities of the contractors in developing and implementing the site-specific\nCEMPs, SOPs and monitoring environmental compliance with the ESMP 89/CEMP;\n\u00a7 Responsibility of the contractors in engaging with affected persons for project GRM\n\u00a7 Create awareness of sexually-transmitted diseases (HIV/AIDs), child labor, bonded\nlabor or forced labor\n\u00a7 Record and maintain briefing and orientation events log with duration and list of\nattendees\n\u00a7 Under the supervision of the PIC and prior to mobilizing on site, contractors will\nconduct training and drills for workers on:\no CEMP sub-plans implementation\no Environmental, health and safety and hygiene at work sites as well as sexually\ntransmitted disease such as HIV/AIDS to prevent potential incidences\no Record and maintain briefing and orientation events log with duration and list\nof attendees\n(B) Hiring Of Project Staff and Workers\n271. Project implementation will bring opportunities for local employment. While this is\nbeneficial, it may also be a cause of conflict over transparency of hiring particularly if migrant\nworkers are recruited over local people. The PRAC's sub-contractors will be required to use\nlocal labor for manual work and eligible local workforce for technical and administrative jobs.\n(C) Presence of Workers at Construction Sites\n272. The presence of workers and staff at the project sites may increase demand for\nservices such as food and beverages. The localized demand of services may result in an\nopportunity for local communities to set up temporary small-scale business in providing food\n89 PIC will develop checklists for use in monitoring environmental compliance during construction stage.\n132\n133\nand beverages outside the solar plant. This will be a beneficial impact to local economy.\n(D) Preparation of Construction Environmental Management Plans/Standard Operating\nProcedures for 60MW solar plant\n273. The CEMP of 60MW solar plant will help to avoid unplanned activities of PRAC\u2019s\ncontractors and will guide the smooth implementation of all project activities. Prior to\nmobilizing on site, PRAC will develop a site-specific CEMP for the key activities; appropriate\nmaps showing where activities will take place and corresponding implementation schedule.\nThe Plant\u2019s CEMP will follow the advice of National Solar Park\u2019s PIC who will prepare the\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the whole National Solar Park in line with the\nenvironmental component likely to be affected.90 The Plant\u2019s CEMP will include the sub-plans\nlisted in Table 35 and will be submitted to PMO for approval.\nTable 35: List of Construction Environmental Management Plans (CEMP Sub-plans) for 60 MW\nsolar plant\nEnvironmental Component Plant CEMP Subplans\nLikely to be Affected\nLand and Vegetation \u2022 Spoils Disposal Plan\n\u2022 Hazardous Material Control Plan\n\u2022 Site Rehabilitation and Clean up Plan\nAir Noise and Dust Control Plan\nWater Drainage and Storm-water Management Plan\nWaste \u2022 Materials Management Plan (including warehouse/\nstorage)\n\u2022 Waste Management Plan\n\u2022 Storage and Final Dispoal Plan for Redundant/Broken\nSolar Panels\nHumans \u2022 Sub-contractor's Local Recruitment and Training Plan (to\n(Communities / Workers) include special opportunities for women and women\ngroups)\n\u2022 Worker Influx Plan (Table 8 above in Section 3.7.2)\n\u2022 Worker Accommodation Plan for Temporary Worker\nCamp (see Section 3.7.2)\n\u2022 Community Health and Safety Plan\n\u2022 Occupational Health and Safety Plan (including worker\u2019s\nfacilities and work areas)\n\u2022 Emergency Response Plan (ERP)\n\u2022 Traffic and Road Management Plan\nPhysical Cultural Resources Chance Find Procedures\n90 SOPs / O&M manuals will be developed taking reference from the CEMP sub-plans except for Spoils Disposal Plan which\nwill not be required during the Operation Stage.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 146 ---\n| Environmental Component\nLikely to be Affected | Plant CEMP Subplans |\n| --- | --- |\n| Land and Vegetation | \u2022 Spoils Disposal Plan\n\u2022 Hazardous Material Control Plan\n\u2022 Site Rehabilitation and Clean up Plan |\n| Air | Noise and Dust Control Plan |\n| Water | Drainage and Storm-water Management Plan |\n| Waste | \u2022 Materials Management Plan (including warehouse/\nstorage)\n\u2022 Waste Management Plan\n\u2022 Storage and Final Dispoal Plan for Redundant/Broken\nSolar Panels |\n| Humans\n(Communities / Workers) | \u2022 Sub-contractor's Local Recruitment and Training Plan (to\ninclude special opportunities for women and women\ngroups)\n\u2022 Worker Influx Plan (Table 8 above in Section 3.7.2)\n\u2022 Worker Accommodation Plan for Temporary Worker\nCamp (see Section 3.7.2)\n\u2022 Community Health and Safety Plan\n\u2022 Occupational Health and Safety Plan (including worker\u2019s\nfacilities and work areas)\n\u2022 Emergency Response Plan (ERP)\n\u2022 Traffic and Road Management Plan |\n| Physical Cultural Resources | Chance Find Procedures |\n\n6.5.1 Physical Landscape\n274. 60MW solar plant will involve vegetation clearance and soil compaction. Due to the\ntopographical location of the project and the surrounding forest cover, the changes to physical\nlandscape in the project development area will not be visible or have an impact beyond the\nproject\u2019s immediate vicinity.\n275. This is because the 60MW solar plant site has been historically modified for use as\ncassava plantations. The 60MW solar plant has been designed to minimize adverse physical\nimpacts to the surrounding landscape by minimizing the Project Footprint and blending major\nproject components with the surrounds to the extent practicable.\n6.5.2 Topography\n276. Land leveling and grading works may alter drainage patterns at the solar plant site that\nmay result in surface erosion, generation of spoil and localized flooding. Impacts will also\nresult from installation of equipment, installation of cable routes (above ground and/or\nunderground) and commissioning of new equipment. These impacts will be temporary and\nlocalized at the construction sites within the solar plant.\n277. Management measures\n\u00a7 Clear demarcation of work sites, no encroachment outside the demarcated zone\n\u00a7 Access to adjacent properties and agricultural land will be maintained, as necessary\n\u00a7 Construction camp/ workers accommodation set up at least 100 m from natural\nstreams or any other water source at site including drainage/irrigation canals and\ndykes. Workers\u2019 accommodation: processes and standards\u2014a guidance will be\nreferred to at the time of construction91.\n\u00a7 Implement engineering and biological measures to prevent surface erosion such as\nprovision of silt traps or sowing soil-binding grass, as needed.\n\u00a7 Restore loose soil from foundations through ramming, if required\n\u00a7 Implement the following CEMP sub-plans\n\u00a7 Spoils Disposal Plan92\n\u00a7 Drainage and Storm-water Management Plan\n278. Site Rehabilitation and Clean up Plan after completion of civil works to restore works\nsite to pre-construction conditions including landscaping along the fenced perimeter, maintain\nhedges and field margins to reduce visual and dust impact, re-seeding most or all of the site\nwith native plant species (soil binding grass) to stabilize the soil and restore habitat\n6.5.3 Air Quality\n279. Potential air quality impacts during construction include dust emissions associated\nwith earthworks and gaseous emissions from construction activities and heavy vehicles used\nto support the construction works. Some concerning activities are wind-borne dust emissions\nfrom cleared areas, stockpiles, and unpaved site roads; truck-derived dust emissions from\n91 The guideline can be retrieved from\nhttps://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability-at-\nifc/publications/publications_gpn_workersaccommodation\n92 Excess spoil will be backfilled onsite or temporary / permanently disposed as per the clearly identified disposal sites on\nsite specific map, with corresponding distance and number of trips made will be maintained (this will help avoid disposal\nof spoil on farm land or within 400 m of any water source).\n134\n135\ntraffic on haulage routes and dumping; and dozer- and excavator-derived dust emissions from\nclearing operations and earthworks.\n280. Moderate temporary air quality impacts during peak construction phase of the project\nare anticipated because of construction activities scheduled in the dry season and due to\nfugitive dust generation associated with construction works and transport (of materials,\nequipment and machinery), loading, unloading and haulage of materials and corresponding\nincrease in vehicular emissions. Use of construction machinery and equipment and movement\nof transport vehicles may also levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), affecting\nair quality. Building access roads to project site (asphalt road pavement) will produce fumes\ncontaining small quantities of toxic and hazardous chemicals such as volatile organic\ncompounds (VOC) and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).\n281. Management measures\n\u00a7 Particulate dust generation will be minimized by restricting land clearing to the areas\nflagged for immediate use, progressively rehabilitating exposed soils as soon as\npracticable, avoiding clearing and earthworks activities during dry, windy conditions,\nand applying water to all cleared, road and stockpile areas whenever weather\nconditions have the potential to mobilize fugitive dust. Open burning (e.g. of\nvegetation, waste, hydrocarbons) will be avoided.\n\u00a7 A detailed management and monitoring plan for air quality is provided in the\nEnvironmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the Project, which will monitor\nemissions generated during construction.\n\u00a7 General air quality management and mitigation measures are as follows.\n\u2022 Conduct awareness training on dust emissions for project employees and\nworkforce\n\u2022 Restrict speed limit on unsealed roads to minimize dust generation\n\u2022 Conduct topsoil stripping when soil is moist to the extent practical\n\u2022 Monitor for air quality impacts near sensitive receptors identified near\nconstruction areas and along the access roads\n\u2022 Use low-sulphur fuels where practical\n\u2022 Source low-emission diesel equipment (e.g. Tier 2 or better) where practical\n\u00a7 The contractors will conduct air quality monitoring at the solar plant site once before\nstart of the civil works to establish the baseline, bi-monthly during the civil works and\nonce after completion of the civil works to monitor and mitigate exceedances (if any)\nwith respect to the Ambient Air Quality Standards (see Table below).\nTable 36: MoE's air quality standards\nParameters Analytical Methods Unite Standard* Time\nTotal Suspended Particles Weight Concentrate Measuring mg/m3 0.33 24h\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2) Pararosaniline mg/m3 0.3 24h\nCarbon Monoxide (CO) Detection Tube mg/m3 20 8h\nNitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Saltzman Method mg/m3 0.1 24h\nParticulate Matter (PM10) Weight Concentrate Measuring mg/m3 0.05 24h\nParticulate Mater (PM2.5) Weight Concentrate Measuring mg/m3 0.025 24h\nOzone (O3) Potassium iodide (KI) mg/m3 0.5 1h\n\n\n--- Table on Page 148 ---\n| Parameters | Analytical Methods | Unite | Standard* | Time |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total Suspended Particles | Weight Concentrate Measuring | mg/m3 | 0.33 | 24h |\n| Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) | Pararosaniline | mg/m3 | 0.3 | 24h |\n| Carbon Monoxide (CO) | Detection Tube | mg/m3 | 20 | 8h |\n| Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) | Saltzman Method | mg/m3 | 0.1 | 24h |\n| Particulate Matter (PM10) | Weight Concentrate Measuring | mg/m3 | 0.05 | 24h |\n| Particulate Mater (PM2.5) | Weight Concentrate Measuring | mg/m3 | 0.025 | 24h |\n| Ozone (O3) | Potassium iodide (KI) | mg/m3 | 0.5 | 1h |\n\nLead (Pb) ICP-MS mg/m3 0.005 24h\nNote: *Declaration on Uses of Term of Reference for Establishment of Factory and Handicraft (2018)\n\u00a7 Air monitoring will be conducted utilizing hand held air monitoring devices at select\nlocations identified on site map as the samples collected during the assessment.\n\u00a7 Open and exposed land areas at the solar plant site will be sprayed with water to\nsuppress dust levels particularly during the dry season.\n\u00a7 Use of chemical dust suppressants will be prohibited.\n\u00a7 Aside from this, works sites will be temporarily barricaded to enclose to control dust\nlevels\n\u00a7 Storage areas/warehouse for materials required for construction and civil works will\nbe provided onsite (construction camps at the solar plant) to reduce construction\nvehicle trips of transporting materials and minimize stockpiling\n\u00a7 Vehicles transporting materials that generate dusts will be covered with tarps.\nConstruction vehicles and machinery will be maintained to a high standard to minimize\nvehicular emissions and noise.\n\u00a7 Log of monitoring/incidences of non-compliance and rectification will be recorded and\nmaintained.\n6.5.4 Noise and vibration\n282. Noise impacts will be temporary and localized at all construction sites as construction\nmachinery and vehicles generate noise as they operate. Other noise sources include loading,\nunloading and haulage of equipment and materials. Significant noise impacts will be\nexperienced by construction site workers/operators; construction machinery may produce\nnoise levels up to 90 A-weighted decibels (dBA). For the solar plant site, only construction\nworkers will be this close to the machinery for extended periods of time. Measurement of\nnoise levels at the 60 MW solar plant site was conducted once prior to start of the civil works\nto establish the baseline, bi-monthly during the civil works and once after completion of the\ncivil works (the latter will be conducted at the 60 MW solar plant site only/upon\ncommissioning of the substation) to monitor and mitigate exceedances (if any), with respect\nto the Ambient Noise Standards. The potential impacts due to noise and vibration will be\nmitigated by the following measures as set out in the ESMP.\n283. Potential vibration and noise impacts include those associated with vehicle\nmovements, heavy machinery and construction activities. Since there are no nearby residents\nwithin 3km around the project, potential noise and vibration impacts are primarily issues for\nworkers onsite. Sources of noise and vibration associated with project construction include:\n\u2022 Light vehicle movements associated with personnel arrival/departure and onsite\nactivities\n\u2022 Earthworks in the Project area using heavy machinery (clearing, grubbing and cutting)\n\u2022 Earthworks associated with upgrade of the project internal roads\n\u2022 Concrete foundation works\n\u2022 Building and facility construction\n\u2022 Heavy vehicle movements associated with delivery of equipment, building materials,\nand infrastructure\n284.

During construction, sediment management will be critical to prevent water quality\nimpacts due to erosion and suspended sediment transport impacts associated with land\n\n\n--- Table on Page 150 ---\n| Noise by time | Standard* | Vibration by time | Standard* |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Day Time (6:00-18:00) | 70 dB(A) | Day Time (6:00-18:00) | 65 dB |\n| Evening Time (18:00-22:00) | 65 dB(A) | Night Time (18:00-6:00) | 60 dB |\n| Night Time (22:00-6:00) | 50 dB(A) |  |  |\n\nclearance and major earthworks. The removal of vegetation on site and along watercourses\ncould increase erosion and impact local aquatic biodiversity. Surface and near-surface waters\nnear the project area are contaminated and will require management and/or treatment.\n286. Any accidental spills of fuel, grey water or septic systems could potentially contaminate\nreceiving waters. Wastes from construction activities have minimal potential to affect the\nwater quality in the Praek Mkak and other water bodies if unmanaged. Significant generation\nof construction waste is expected during this phase from land clearance, construction activity,\nand workforce activities. The potential surface water quality impacts associated with the\nProject construction phase and which are to be managed by the project include:\n\u2022 Erosion and sedimentation as a result of earthworks and land clearing\n\u2022 Release of oil, grease and hydrocarbon pollution associated with vehicles and\nheavy machinery\n\u2022 Release of pathogen and nutrient pollution associated with human activity,\naccommodation, sewage treatment and putrescible waste\n287. Management measures\n\u2022 To the extent practical, earthworks will be avoided during the wet season and\nperiods of heavy rain, unless earthworks are needed to prevent erosion;\n\u2022 Clearance of vegetation from water courses will be avoided wherever practical,\nleaving a minimum 100m of undisturbed riparian/forest cover on both sides of\nwatercourses within the project area\n\u2022 Use of herbicides/pesticides will be prohibited for vegetation clearing to\nprevent soil contamination\n\u2022 All waste from land clearing, building activities, and accommodation will be\ncollected, stored and disposed of safely in a manner that prevents any release\nof leachate into the Praek Mkak\n\u2022 All chemicals and hydrocarbons will be handled and stored appropriately\naccording to the ESMP and associated standard operation procedures, with\nadequate bunding, inspection, auditing and contingency measures\n\u2022 Mandatory personnel inductions will include awareness of water pollution\nissues and management, and project regulations will be enacted to prevent\npolluting activities that may pose a threat to the Praek Mkak\n\u2022 Surface water quality monitoring will be conducted at the solar plant site and\nthe downstream of An Long Chrey reservoir once before start of the civil works\nto establish the baseline, once during the civil works and once after completion\nof the civil works to ascertain if any changes have occurred with respect to\nMoE's Surface Water Quality Standards (see Table below).\nTable 38: MoE's surface water quality standards\nNo. Surface water quality parameters Unit Standard*\n1 Temperature oC <45\n2 pH - 6-9\n3 Total Suspended Solid (TSS) mg/l <120\n4 Dissolved Oxygen (DO) mg/l >1\n5 Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) mg/l <80\n138\n\n\n--- Table on Page 151 ---\n|  | No. |  |  | Surface water quality parameters |  |  | Unit |  |  | Standard* |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 |  |  | Temperature |  |  | oC |  |  | <45 |  |  |\n| 2 |  |  | pH |  |  | - |  |  | 6-9 |  |  |\n| 3 |  |  | Total Suspended Solid (TSS) |  |  | mg/l |  |  | <120 |  |  |\n| 4 |  |  | Dissolved Oxygen (DO) |  |  | mg/l |  |  | >1 |  |  |\n| 5 |  |  | Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) |  |  | mg/l |  |  | <80 |  |  |\n\n139\n6 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) mg/l <100\n7 Total Nitrogen (TN) mg/l <6\n8 Total Phosphorus (TP) mg/l <5\n9 Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) mg/l <2000\n10 Oil or Grease mg/l <15\n11 Detergent mg/l <15\n12 Sulfate (SO4) mg/l <500\n13 Asenic (As) mg/l <1\n14 Iron (Fe) mg/l <20\n15 Mecury (Hg) mg/l <0.05\n16 (Total Coliform) mg/l <1000\nNote: *Declaration on Uses of Term of Reference for Establishment of Factory and Handicraft (2018)\n\u2022 Compliance with Sub-decree No. 27 ANRK.BK on Water Pollution Control, MOE,\n1999\n\u2022 Construction camps to be established at least 400 m from any water source\n\u2022 No washing or repair of equipment/machinery will take within 100 meters of\nany water source.\n\u2022 Provision for a temporary secured hazardous materials handling and waste\nstorage area will be provided across all work sites including site for broken and\nredundant solar panels.\n\u2022 Provision for a temporary secured hazardous materials handling and waste\nstorage area will be provided across all work sites including site for broken and\nredundant solar panels\n\u2022 Provide temporary sanitary facilities (e.g. pit latrines/portable toilets) to\nworkers and safe drinking water\n\u2022 Groundwater abstraction will be avoided\n\u2022 Contractors to include in the construction schedule estimates of anticipated\nannual water usage and sources of water for construction\n\u2022 Implement CEMP Sub-plan\n\u2022 Drainage and Storm-water Management Plan\n288. All activities will be supervised by PMO\u2019s HS officer, Environment Officer, Social Officer\nand monitored by PMO of PRAC.\n6.5.6 Groundwater Quality\n289. There are some potential effluences for groundwater contamination, i.e.\ncontamination of soil and groundwater with oil, grease and hydrocarbon pollution associated\nwith vehicles and heavy machinery; and with pathogen and nutrient pollution associated with\nhuman activity, accommodation, sewage treatment and putrescible waste.\n290. Management measures\n\u2022 All chemicals and hydrocarbons will be handled and stored appropriately\naccording to the ESMP and associated standard operation procedures, with\nadequate bunding, hardstand preparation including lining, concreting or\ncompaction, as well as inspection, auditing and contingency measures.\n\u2022 Septic tank will be installed to keep contain wastewater from toilets and\n\n\n--- Table on Page 152 ---\n| 6 | Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) | mg/l | <100 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7 | Total Nitrogen (TN) | mg/l | <6 |\n| 8 | Total Phosphorus (TP) | mg/l | <5 |\n| 9 | Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) | mg/l | <2000 |\n| 10 | Oil or Grease | mg/l | <15 |\n| 11 | Detergent | mg/l | <15 |\n| 12 | Sulfate (SO4) | mg/l | <500 |\n| 13 | Asenic (As) | mg/l | <1 |\n| 14 | Iron (Fe) | mg/l | <20 |\n| 15 | Mecury (Hg) | mg/l | <0.05 |\n| 16 | (Total Coliform) | mg/l | <1000 |\n\nkitchens to prevent pollution to groundwater.\n\u2022 Groundwater quality is to be monitored once before start of the civil works to\nestablish the baseline, once during the civil works and once after completion\nof the civil works. Important quality parameters to be monitored are EC,\nTurbidity, TDS, Total Hardness, Flouride, NO3, SO4, CL, E-Coli, Al, As, Cd, Cr, Fe,\nHg, and Mn.\n6.5.7 Hydrology\n291. The predicted impacts on hydrology associated with the Project construction phase\nand which are to be managed by the Project include:\n\u2022 Increased surface runoff from the developed areas of the catchment\n\u2022 Slightly altered flow regime in ephemeral waterways downstream of Praek\nMkak\n\u2022 Water abstraction from the Praek Mkak may be required to support\nconstruction activities\n292. Management measures\n\u2022 The project has been designed to minimize long-term negative impacts to\nsurface water drainage, flood risk levels, and local hydrology within and\ndownstream of the project area.\n\u2022 Surface runoff from developed areas of the project is to be controlled by the\ninstallation of drainage channels, and contained by the construction of\n(sedimentation) ponds in order to minimize erosion and flood risk.\n\u2022 Monitoring the surrounding hydrology will be conducted for every six months\n6.5.8 Soil Quality\n293. Vegetation on the 60 MW Plant site will be cleared in preparation for the construction\nof project components. Measures are therefore required to minimize soil erosion (by rain and\nwind) and prevent sediment release to the Praek Mkak. Soil compaction within active\nconstruction areas is likely due to heavy traffic passage and construction activities. Soil\ncontamination from accidental leaks/spills of hydrocarbons, oil, grease, chemicals and\nsewage/wastewater effluent is also possible and will require management.\n294. Management measures\n\u2022 The project has been designed to minimize long-term negative impacts to soil\nfunction in the project site by recovering topsoil stripped from clearing and\nconstruction activities and subsequently for progressive and final rehabilitation.\n\u2022 Land clearing is to be limited to the immediate project site required for\ndevelopment to the extent practical\n\u2022 Activities involving chemicals or hydrocarbons (including storage of broken and\nredundant solar panels) are to be restricted to designated areas that have been\nprepared with appropriate bunding, a concrete or compacted earth base, and\nfully contained by drainage controls\n\u2022 An appropriate sanitation system is to be provided to collect all waste and\nsewage for proper storage and disposal;\n\u2022 Strict controls on the use of sanitation facilities will be implemented through\neducation and enforcement.\n140\n141\n\u2022 Soil quality monitoring will be conducted for every six months.\n6.5.9 Waste Generation\n295. Impacts due to waste generation during construction stage have been assessed for all\ninfrastructure types under the 60 MW solar plant and discussed as follows. Impacts on\nresource use and impacts associated with disposal will arise from waste generated during site\npreparation and civil works. This includes generation of inert wastes e.g. spoil, biodegradable\nwastes e.g. cleared vegetation, construction debris, packaging waste, metal scrap, domestic\nwaste. Impacts of disposal and wind-blown litter will be seen at the construction areas\nwhereas the impacts of resource use are national and global.\n296. Management measure\n\u00a7 Compliance with Sub-decree No. 36 ANRK.BK on Solid Waste Management, MOE, 1999\n\u00a7 For broken/redundant solar panels, there will be proper storages for each type of\ndisposal. The final disposal of redundant/broken panels will be sent to recycling\nprocess depending on types of disposal.\n\u00a7 Establish a covered onsite storing, sorting, and recycling area away from existing water\nsources, drainage /irrigation canals or water sources. This includes an area to store\nbroken and redundant solar panels.\n\u00a7 Transport of recyclables, scrap, discarded equipment to PRAC depots, dedicated\nstorage yards for resale or auction to authorized dealers. The broken or damaged solar\nparnels will be sold to a solar planel specializing in recycling.\n\u00a7 For other type of wastes, licensed companies will be hired to collect, transport and\ndispose of wastes at licensed dump facilities\n\u00a7 Biodegradable waste such as cleared vegetation may be provided to local communities\nfor use\n\u00a7 Provide multiple waste containers at construction camps\n\u00a7 Waste burning will be prohibited\n\u00a7 No final waste disposal on site\n6.5.10 Biological Impacts\n297. A biodiversity assessment has been carried out for the project; the flora and fauna\nrecorded during the data search, ground surveys and consultations did not reveal the\npresence of species or habitats of particular conservation value within the project area of\ninfluence.\n298. There are no protected areas or community forests in or around the solar plant site.\nThe Phnom Aural NPA is located within 20 km of the solar plant site and 300 ha Tbeng Srong\ncommunity forest in Chhean Laeung commune is located approximately 5-7 km from the solar\nplant site in the northeast direction. Local interviews with villagers in the Chaen Laeung\ncommune, which borders the Tbeng Srong community forest have suggested the possible\npresence of endangered and vulnerable species of mammals and reptiles in the forest such as\nDhole, Fishing Cat, Asiatic Jackal, and Burmese Python. The interviewed locals also suggested\npossible presence of rich bird species diversity (species found typically in forested areas,\nwetlands and rural areas)93. No direct or indirect adverse impacts are anticipated on the\nnational protected area (NPA) or the community forest as a result of construction activities at\nthe solar plant site. Construction impacts on terrestrial flora and fauna within the solar plant\nsite will be negligible because the site is located in areas of modified habitat consisting of\npaddy fields and scrubland94 disturbed by human activity.\n6.5.11 Vegetation impacts\n299. The most significant impact to terrestrial habitats and flora associated with the project\nis expected to occur during the Construction Phase when habitats within the project footprint\nwill be cleared. The project site is located further away (16km) on the south-eastern part of\nthe Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary (PAWS), therefore habitat clearance will not result in the\nloss of natural and modified habitats from within the PAWS or even within the project site\nsince the area has been long modified and no critical habitats are found.\n300. Management measures\n\u2022 Construction camps to be set up at least 100m from any water source,\ndrainage/irrigation canals or dykes\n\u2022 Access to adjacent properties and agricultural land will be maintained, as\nnecessary\n\u2022 Vegetation clearances will be strictly restricted to work sites\n\u2022 Use of herbicides/pesticides will be prohibited for vegetation clearing to\nprevent soil contamination\n\u2022 Excess spoil will be backfilled onsite or spread out in a manner that causes no\ndisturbance to existing drainage/irrigation canals, dykes or local drainage\npattern\n\u2022 Implement the following CEMP sub-plans\n\u2022 Strictly implement the Spoils Disposal plan95\n\u2022 Drainage and Storm-water Management Plan\n\u2022 Site Rehabilitation and Clean-up Plan after completion of civil works to pre-\nconstruction conditions including vegetation planting to stabilize soil where it\ndoes not compromise the intended function.\n\u2022 Vegetation monitoring will be monitoring for six months during the\nconstruction period.\n6.5.12 Fauna Impacts\n301. The significant impact to priority fauna will be the loss of a proportion of their habitat\nduring construction. This impact will largely be localized and restricted to the approximately\n97 ha of modified habitat to be removed for project. As preparatory works begin, the on-site\nspecies will move into other parts of their range. Other priority birds, reptiles and small\nmammals have a wide habitat tolerance and are likely to move into similar habitat elsewhere.\n93 The interviewee said the observations were in the last five years and there has been a decline in sightings due to change\nin land use and hunting.\n94 Solar park site is mainly scrubland (293 ha) and paddy fields (116 ha); small plantations such as cassava, mango, cashew,\neucalyptus and bamboo.\n95 Excess spoil will be backfilled onsite or temporary/permanently disposed as per the clearly identified disposal sites on site\nspecific map, with corresponding distance and number of trips made will be maintained (this will help avoid disposal of\nspoil on farm land or within 400 m of any water source).\n142\n143\n302. Management measures\n\u2022 The project will design a plant layout to avoid most sensitive habitats including\nmaintaining the buffer zone for instance to keep habitats as possible.\n\u2022 The project will avoid direct and indirect impacts to areas of biodiversity\nsensitivity (e.g. Praek Mkak).\n\u2022 Habitat clearance will be undertaken in a progressive and sensitive manner to\nenable priority fauna to move away from the area of works and to avoid\nisolating fauna in fragmented areas of habitat.\n\u2022 Adverse impact to habitats, flora and fauna arising from fugitive dust will be\nminimized through the regular application of water to reduce dust levels in\nareas of biodiversity sensitivity (particularly during the dry season), the\nstabilization of landforms, and the implementation of erosion prevention\nmeasures.\n\u2022 Raise awareness with workforce and local villagers about importance of\nprotecting forest resources and conservation important species and their\nhabitats.\n\u2022 Fauna monitoring will be conducted for six months during this construction\nperoid.\n6.5.13 Fishery and other aquatic biodiversity\n303. The Praek Mkak is a closed tributary of the An Long Chrey reservoir and provides\nsignificant aquatic habitat and ecosystem services. Several minor ephemeral creeks in and\naround the project site will be slightly modified for the construction of associated components.\nVegetated areas occurring within the Project Footprint will also be cleared. Potential impacts\ntherefore include:\n\u2022 Release of suspended sediment from construction activities\n\u2022 Clearing or modification of watercourses in the project site\n\u2022 Accidental spills of diesel fuel\n304. Management measures\n\u2022 The project design minimizes potential impacts to aquatic habitat by\nminimizing the construction footprint, which avoids local wetlands and\nwaterways to the extent possible and primarily drains into a single catchment\n\u2013 Praek Mkak.\n\u2022 Riparian habitats will be retained where possible to maintain a degree of\nfunctionality, including a 100 m buffer zone around watercourses\n\u2022 Proper transport, storage, handling and disposal procedures for hazardous\nsubstances will be developed and implemented to prevent spills and leaks\nentering the Praek Mkak and tributaries.\n\u2022 Personnel and contractors will be prohibited, as a condition of employment,\nfrom fishing and trading in aquatic natural resources.\n305. The potential impacts on ecological resources will be mitigated by the following\nmeasures as set out in the ESMP:\n\u2022 Minimize vegetation clearing confined to the footprint of the solar plant area\n\u2022 No use of chemicals (pesticides/herbicides)\n\u2022 Maintain hedges and field margins along the solar plant perimeter\n\u2022 After completion of civil works, implement Site Rehabilitation and Clean Up\nPlan including landscaping along the fenced perimeter of the solar plant, re-\nseeding most or all of the site with native species of plants\n\u2022 Provision for adequate ground clearance under fencing for allowing passage of\nanimals/wild species to prevent habitat fragmentation\n\u2022 Restoring temporarily disturbed areas to pre-construction conditions\n\u2022 Any identified bat roosting sites will not be disturbed\n\u2022 Monitoring to the fishery resource will be conducted for six months.\n6.5.14 Local Economic Development and Employment\n\u2022 Despite the generally positive impact the Project will have on economic\ndevelopment and short-term local employment during construction, there is a\nrisk of inequitable employment, training and procurement opportunities or\ninadequate communication leading to community dissatisfaction.\n\u2022 As management measures, the project will develop a preferential local\nrecruitment, training and procurement plans and procedures in accordance\nwith NSP advice and requirements. Implementation of social management and\nmonitoring as per the ESMP and sub-plans: Stakeholder Engagement Plan, and\nGrievance Mechanism.\n6.5.15 Agricultural Land Use\n\u2022 The Project will not directly or indirectly impact on agriculture-based\nlivelihoods of the local communities in the area of influence.\n6.5.16 Forest Resource Use\n306. Project construction will result in the removal of small bushes in the project footprint,\nexclusion of the public from the project site and its resources, and the potential for increased\npressure on forest resources from local villagers.\n307. Management measure\n\u2022 The project will demarcate the project boundary and avoid the key community\nforest collection areas when siting infrastructure in the Project design.\n\u2022 The project will ban on unauthorized collection of forest resources, including\nplants, and firewood within and around the project areas.\n\u2022 The project will set up a grievance mechanism.\n\u2022 The project will monitor the vegetation clearance to avoid any vast and\nunnecessary clearance.\n6.5.17 Water Uses\n308. There is a slight risk to downstream water users related to the possibility of impacts\non water quality associated with project construction activities including contamination of\nwater resources with sediment and chemicals such as diesel, grease and oil. Other impacts\nmay arise from modifications to local creeks/drainages. Groundwater is not a significant\nsource of water for the project, and no significant impacts on groundwater quality or\navailability are expected during the construction phase.\n144\n145\n309. Management measures\n\u2022 All hydrocarbons, oils and greases and other hazardous materials will be\nhandled, stored and used in designated areas according to standard operation\nprocedures with adequate bunding, hardstand preparation (e.g. lining,\nconcreting or compaction), inspection, auditing and contingency measure\n\u2022 Mandatory personnel inductions will include awareness of water pollution\nissues and management.\n6.5.18 Occupational Health and Safety\n310. During the construction phase, more workers will be employed to support project\nconstruction, to be housed on site in the Project's temporary worker's camp. The key factors\nthat will pose risks to worker health and safety are movement of heavy machinery and high\nvolumes of traffic on site. The main risks to worker health and safety and other risks such as\nfire.\n311. Management measures:\n\u2022 The project will demarcate exclusion and safety zones around high risk area.\n\u2022 The project will strictly require all workers wear personal protective equipment\nappropriate to their duties with signage at designated sites.\n\u2022 Clinical assistance will be available to project personnel and medical\nemergency evacuation procedures will be developed.\n\u2022 Fatigue will be monitored and managed during travel and during on site\noperations.\n\u2022 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the safe handling, storage and\ntransportation of associated facilities and materials.\n\u2022 The project will strictly implement the management and monitoring measures\nas per ESMP for water quality, waste management, air, health and safety, noise\nand vibration and transport measures.\n\u2022 Implement CEMP sub-plan on Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Plan\n\u2022 Establish and implement ERPs as required\n\u2022 Compliance with Cambodia Occupational Safety and Health laws and\nregulations, Department of Safety and Health, Ministry of Labour and\nVocational Training (MLVT), 201196\n\u2022 Provide sanitary facilities and wash areas, safe drinking water and garbage bins\n\u2022 Provide health assessments (health and fitness to workers once every two\nmonths)\n\u2022 Periodic training will be provided to workers in all aspects of the ERP and OHS\n\u2022 For infectious disease, there will be training to all workers for self-prevention,\nclean living, and regularly (once per day) fogging activities at the temporary\nworkers camp for mosquito control.\n\u2022 Coordinate with nearest hospital for arrangements in case of accidents\n\u2022 provide first aid treatment for construction sites and camp\n\u2022 Assess safety risks and safety protocols (such as for electrical works, working at\nheights, etc.), and implement\n\u2022 Workers will be equipped with PPE including proper safety clothes and\n96 MLVT- Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training\nprotection gear/equipment to avoid accidents\n\u2022 Provide communication devices to designated site officers / engineers\n\u2022 Electrical safety risks will be assessed and safety protocols will be developed\nand implemented such as for electrical works, working at heights, etc.\n\u2022 All works at height will be prohibited during night time, periods off fog and\nstrong wind on the Beaurfort Wind Scale97\n\u2022 All workers climbing towers will have a Safety Certificate of Class 398 or above\n\u2022 All towers, steel structures and equipment will be properly earthed and\nequipped with lightening protection\n\u2022 When testing electrical equipment, all unrelated works in the flagged zone \u2013\nmarked as danger zone - will be stopped and unrelated workers will leave the\nzone\n\u2022 Records of health assessments/incidents/accidents/near-miss/fatalities will be\nmaintained\n6.5.19 Community Health and Safety\n312. Site preparation and civil works, movement of vehicles bringing equipment, materials,\nsupplies and machinery may interfere with road crossings, flow of traffic and may cause an\nincrease in traffic congestion. These activities may pose safety risks to the communities\nresiding in close proximity to the work sites and general public. In addition, construction\ncamps and an influx of workers may cause social conflict or even lead to the spread of any\ncomunicable diseases. Contractors will obtain permissions from relevant authorities before\ncommencement of activities. A code of conduct will be developed for all relevant stakeholder\nand workers to keep the work organized and safe in the ESMP.\n313. The Project may also generate (fugitive) dust mainly from upgrading the access road,\nclearing the forestland for infrastructure, and transportation of materials and equipment.\nNoise from these activities may also disturb nearby residents at night as well as impact on\ndaily economic/business activities. Also, during the Construction Phase, the project may lead\nto a number of key risks for community health, food security and safety, including:\n\u2022 Safety impacts will be primarily associated with accidents involving company\nvehicles along the project access road. During construction in particular, there\nwill be a significant increase in project traffic.\n\u2022 Potential psycho-social and health impacts among Project personnel\nassociated with air quality, noise, and vibration effects.\n314. Management measures\n\u2022 Enforce the workers' code of conduct to avoid conflicts, and prevent sexual\nexploitation and harrassment among workers and community members.\n97The Beaufort Wind Scale is an empirical measure with 12 wind speed classes. Winds above Class V are higher than 10.8\nm/sec.\n98Electric Safety Classification is regulated in Circular 31/2014/TT-BCT (2014). The Circular stipulates five Safety Classifications\n(1 to 5), with 5 being the highest. A Class 3 Safety Certificate designates a worker capable of working in the field, and is\ngiven to workers/technicians who: 1) pass 80% of the training; 2) have knowledge of the proper use of PPE; 3) master the\nmethod to extract an electrocuted victim from the power source; 4) can provide first aid to an electrocuted victim; 5) is\nable to determine unsafe practices; and 6) is able to supervise electric workers working at height and near electric\nequipment.\n146\n147\n\u2022 Develop the Worker Influx Plan to enforce measures to avoid and manage\ninfectious diseases.\n\u2022 Security fencing and patrols to prevent safety impacts from any construction\nactivities undertaken during construction.\n\u2022 Potential noise impacts will be reduced to acceptable levels through scheduled\ndaytime construction, while dust generation will be managed through regular\nwater spraying on major dust sources associated with the project.\n\u2022 The project will strictly implement the management and monitoring measures\nas per ESMP for water quality, waste management, air, health and safety, noise\nand vibration, and transportation; and sub-plans including Emergency\nPreparedness and Response Plan (EPRP), Community Health and Safety Plan,\nStakeholder Engagement Plan, Traffic and Transport Management Plan, and\nWaste Management Plan.\n\u2022 Provide healthcare services for project employees with an appropriately\nstaffed site clinic99.\n\u2022 Effectively control the risks associated with accidents involving multiple\nvehicles, interactions between different types of vehicles with consideration\nfor the volume and speed of traffic, and vehicle and person interactions.\n\u2022 Obeying speed limits and applying additional caution by considering\nenvironmental conditions such as time of day, visibility, precipitation.\n\u2022 Implement an effective site waste management strategy and surface water\ndrainage to prevent the incidence of vector-borne and water-related diseases\n\u2022 Develop a management strategy for worker accommodation in line with\ninternational/national standards to minimize spread of infectious disease and\nfood-related illnesses.\n\u2022 Adhere to strict schedule for completion of civil works and avoid prolonged\nconstruction and disturbance\n\u2022 Implement CEMP Sub-plans\n\u2022 Community Health and Safety Plan\n\u2022 Traffic and Road Management Plan\n\u2022 Provide perimeter fencing to mitigate trespassing (fencing will be constructed\nwith adequate ground clearance for passing of wild animals/other species at\nthe solar plant site)\n\u2022 Provide barricade to temporarily enclose open excavated tower foundations\n\u2022 Provide sufficient lights, clear warning signs and danger signals\n\u2022 Assign security personnel to prevent accidents, trespassing and pilferage\n\u2022 Warning signs and cones will be installed in and around the transmission tower\nsite and along roads, with clearly marked danger zones\n\u2022 Safety flags and flag persons will be used, as needed\n\u2022 Record of incidents/accidents/near-miss/fatalities associated with the project\nwill be maintained\n\u2022 Records of issues raised will be maintained in accordance with GRMs\n\u2022 Outreach to local communities to disseminate knowledge about safety and\nERPs at or near solar plant will be provided via information disclosure and\n99 There will be a first aid kit and healthy and safety staff monitoring during the construction phase.\nconsultation activities, project information booklet (PIB) / frequently asked\nquestions (FAQ) flyers.\n6.5.20 Physical Cultural Resources (PCRs)\n315. There are no known PCRs within the solar plant site. During the construction stage,\nthere may be moderate temporary air quality impacts due to fugitive dust generation and\nnoise to these existing PCRs. These will be mitigated as per the steps detailed under Impacts\non Air Quality, Noise and Vibration and by conducting consultations to avoid sensitive religious\nand spiritual functions/periods. In addition, site preparation and civil works during the\nconstruction stage have the potential to disturb as yet unknown PCRs. A Chance Find\nProcedures will be implemented as necessary. All activities will be supervised by SECU\u2019s HS\nofficer, Social Officer, Environment Officer and monitored by the PMO of PRAC.\n6.5.21 Interruption to Existing Utilities\n316. To reduce impacts on existing utilities (such as power outages), solar plant\nconstruction works and upgrade works will be scheduled in a phased manner. All activities will\nbe supervised by PRAC\u2019s SECU (HS officer, Social Officer, Environment Officer).\n317. Use of Existing Access Roads. Delivery of equipment, materials and machinery to work\nsites at the solar plant may lead to increase in traffic and road congestion. It may cause\ninterference with road crossings during stringing of conductors. Movement of transport\nvehicles will also result in moderate air quality impacts (dust and increase in vehicular\nemissions) as well as an increase in noise (due to operation of transport vehicles) during peak\nconstruction period (these are discussed under Impact on Air Quality, Noise and Vibration).\nThe potential impacts due to increase in traffic and road congestion will be mitigated through\nthe following measures as set out in the ESMP:\n\u2022 Implement Traffic and Road Management Plan\n\u2022 Follow planned transportation routes and delivery schedule\n\u2022 Any traffic detours to have danger and clearly visible warning signs as well as\nflag persons\n\u2022 Compliance with local speed limits vehicle load carrying capacity and other\nroad regulations\n\u2022 Any damage to roads to be borne by Contractor(s)\n\u2022 Record of incidents/accidents/near-miss/fatalities/road damage will be\nmaintained\n6.5.22 Other Risks\n318. Forest fire in the dry season and flooding of the Praek Mkak during the wet season are\nrisks that need to be accounted for in the planning, design and management of the Project.\n319. Management and Mitigation\n\u2022 The project will construct a fire path break around the project boundary to\nprevent forest fires from reaching the solar plant and other facilities.\n\u2022 The project will maintain equipment ready for fire-fighting (e.g. water trucks\nwith water cannons) and train personnel to respond to forest fires in the\nProject area.\n\u2022 A flood-preventing dam is set up at the west of the project to stop rising water\n148\n149\nlevel from flooding the solar plant.\n\u2022 Implement and provide inductions to all staff on the Emergency Preparedness\nand Response Procedures and measures described in the ESMP.\n\u2022 Ongoing engagement with government authorities and consultation with local\ncommunities will form part of a proactive approach to prevent or reduce risk\nof natural hazards to project activities and communities.\n6.6 Operation Stage\n6.6.1 Workforce Organization And Orientation\n320. The SECU (PMO) of PRAC will conduct briefing and orientation for all project staff,\nworkers, and its turnkey contractor/sub-contractors (facility operators):\n\u2022 ESMP, GRM, Information disclosure and meaningful consultation,\nenvironmental monitoring and reporting requirements\n\u2022 Lender and Cambodia labor standards as documented in the human resource\nmanagement plan and local labor recruitment and training plans\n\u2022 Responsibilities of the contractors in implementing SOPs and monitoring\nenvironmental compliance with environmental performance indicators and\nESMP 100\n\u2022 Responsibility of the contractors in engaging with affected persons for project\nGRM\n\u2022 Create awareness of communicable and sexually-transmitted diseases (i.e.\nCOVID-19, HIV/AIDs), child labor, bonded labor or forced labor\n\u2022 Searching for an assessing, monitoring and recording keeping of carcass\nsearches (birds/bats)\n\u2022 Record and maintain briefing and orientation events log with duration and list\nof attendees\n\u2022 Project Operation\n6.6.2 Topography\n321. The landscape changes associated with the development will be limited in duration\n(life of project), with original landscape values restored at closure.\n322. Maintaining and assuring the structural integrity of these project components is\ncritical to prevent health, safety and environmental impacts. Due to the topographical location\nof the project and the surrounding forest cover, the changes to physical landscape in the\nproject development area will not be visible or have an impact beyond the project\u2019s\nimmediate vicinity.\n323. Operation stage impacts on land and vegetation are assessed for all infrastructure\ntypes under project output 1 and discussed as follows.\n324. Vegetation Management. Periodic vegetation maintenance will be undertaken at the\nsolar park site. The potential impacts during operation will be mitigated through the following\nmeasures as set out in the ESMP:\n100 PIC will develop checklists for use in monitoring environmental compliance during construction stage.\n\u2022 Maintain landscaping along the fenced perimeter of the solar park\n\u2022 Maintain hedges and trees at field margins\n\u2022 Employ manual vegetation maintenance methods such as grazing by local\ncattle or manual trimming of grasses and plants within the solar park site and\nemploy local labor\n\u2022 Maintain the re-seeded site\n\u2022 No chemicals (herbicides/pesticides) will be used\n\u2022 To avoid buildups of trimmed vegetation and branches, these will be allowed\nfor collection by local people for firewood or facility operator will contact the\nrelevant local authorities for collection, transport and disposal.\n6.6.3 Landscape Impact\n325. The solar plant will create a visual impact and may result in induced access to the area.\nThe site is not surrounded by habitation or permanent structures. Steps to reduce visual\nimpacts e.g. maintenance of hedges and field margins around the fenced perimeter will be\nincorporated after completion of civil works and during the start of operation. This project will\nshowcase green development of the power sector in Cambodia as well as preserve the local\nbiodiversity. Solar panel glare issues are not anticipated for solar PV plants101.\n6.6.4 Air Quality, Noise and Vibration\n326. Operation of the solar plant, substation, and solar PV plants will not impact the air\nquality except for some fugitive dust generation due to movement of transport vehicles.\nMonitoring of ambient air quality, noise and vibration will be undertaken annually.\n6.6.5 Water Quality\n327. Operation impacts on water quality and resources at the solar plant and associated\nfacilities may result due to excess usage, potential contamination to water sources due to\naccidental spills and leakage as well as due to accidental discharge of wastewater. Contractors\nwithin 60 days of each contract year after the commercial operation date, will be required to\nprovide to the PMO reasonable estimates of water usage for purposes of operating and\nmaintaining the solar PV plant for the applicable contract year.\n328. The potential impacts on water quality and resources will be mitigated by the following\nmeasures as set out in the ESMP.\n\u2022 Through internal drainage system, stormwater will be collected and drainged into\nretention ponds\n\u2022 Maintain storm water retention pond for use for PV cleaning\n\u2022 Periodic cleaning of storm water retention pond to remove debris\n\u2022 No use of chemicals/detergents for cleaning purposes\n\u2022 Provide and maintain permanent sanitary facilities to workers and safe drinking water\n\u2022 Provide and maintain a septic system for wastewater collection and disposal; tank\nsystem will be located at least 100 m from any water sources, to avoid contamination\n\u2022 Maintain permanent secured (\u2018bunded\u2019) areas on impermeable surfaces and dykes\n101 Current glint / glare studies for solar systems at airports have proved that these are not an issue. Source: FS CAM NSPP\nTechnical Team.\n150\n151\ncapable of carrying 110% volume of materials for accidental spills or leakage\n\u2022 Surface water monitoring will be undertaken annually.\n6.6.6 Waste Generation\n329. While it is not expected that solar PV panels at associated facilities within the solar\nplant will require replacement since their life span is 25+ years; however some may fail due to\nrain, humidity or heat. Inverters at the substation will likely be rebuilt as opposed to replaced.\nSmall amounts of domestic solid waste will also be generated at the solar plant site during\noperation. Lack of proper handling, storage and disposal of domestic waste and/or broken PV\npanels may result in adverse impacts. The potential impacts due to waste generation will be\nmitigated by following the measures as set out in the ESMP:\n\u2022 Compliance with Sub-decree No. 36 Solid Waste Management, MoE, 1999\n\u2022 Utilize licensed vendors/suppliers for collection, transportation and disposal of\nbroken/unused PV panels\n\u2022 Also store broken/redundant panels in covered bunded areas for each type of\ndisposal. The final disposal of redundant/broken solar panels will be sent to\nrecycling process depending on types of disposal\n\u2022 Implement SOP for Materials Management and Waste Management\n6.6.7 Ecological Impacts\n330. The large area of PV panels in the solar plant may create a \u2018lake effect\u2019 which could\nattract birds that mistake the solar panels for a water body and the hot panels could kill or\nseriously injure birds, which attempt to land on them especially the young inexperienced ones.\nThere was a similar note from the bird and bat survey in 2019. This ESIA confirms that there\nwill be likely to be little concern over the bird crashes into solar panel since their population\nhas been declined due to the land use changes in the area. Their habitats have changed and,\ntherefore; not many birds are not returning back to site due to no food and habitat attractions.\nTo reduce or avoid bird crashing, PRAC shall install wind-driven bird deterrents (scarers) to\nkeep birds away from the solar panels. Or audible bird deterrents can be used to generate\nfrequencies that could distract the birds (Photo 18). While there may be avifauna migration\nfrom one habitat to another habitat over close distances, for instance, the migration of egret\nand heron species from the natural stream within the solar plant to the downstream reservoir,\nsuch coverage is not anticipated for ground mammals or reptiles due to existing habitat\nfragmentation and sustained human activity. PRAC will conduct the annual monitorings to\nflora, fauna and fishery resources remaining in on site.\nPhoto 18: Bird deterrent devices\nWind-driven bird scarers102 Audible scarer\n102\nhttps://www.scaringbirds.com/wind-powered-scarers/\n6.6.8 Occupational Health and Safety\n331. Contractors will comply with the relevant safety measures required by law and as per\nInternational Best Practices. The potential impacts to workers will be mitigated through the\nfollowing measures as set out in the ESMP:\n\u2022 Implement SOP for Occupational Health and Safety\n\u2022 Compliance to Cambodia Occupational Safety and Health laws and regulations,\nMLVT, 2011\n\u2022 Compliance to relevant national electrical safety standards\n\u2022 Provide and maintain signage as per Institute of Electrical and Electronics\nEngineers standards at dangerous places for warning of electrical hazards\n\u2022 Provide and maintain health assessment by a competent medical practitioner\nfor all workers\n\u2022 Provide periodic training to all workers with access to electrical and hazardous\nconditions and workers will be certified to work on site\n\u2022 Provide and maintain workers appropriate PPE\n\u2022 Equipment and tools will be inspected before use to ensure proper and safe\noperation\n\u2022 For infectious disease, there will be training to all workers for self-prevention,\nclean living, and regularly (once per day) fogging activities at the temporary\nworkers camp for mosquito control.\n\u2022 Appropriate grounding and deactivation of live power equipment during\nmaintenance work or if working in close proximity to the equipment; provision\nof lightning arrestors as appropriate\n\u2022 Record of health assessments, incidents, accidents, near-miss, fatalities will be\nmaintained\n\u2022 EMF levels expected to be below the limits set by International Commission on\nNon-Ionizing Radiation Protection which is 4.17 kV/m for electric field and 833\nmiliGauss for magnetic field; periodic EMF monitoring using hand held devices\nas required\n6.6.9 Community Health and Safety\n332. The presence of a solar plant and its operation may pose potential hazards such as\nelectrocution, lighting strike due to accidental failure of power transmission and exposure to\nEMF. Information and consultation with local residents (community awareness program) and\nauthorities will be conducted intermittently during operation stage. These activities will be\nconducted in and around the villages situated close to the solar plant site.\n333. The potential impacts will be mitigated by the following measures as set out in the\nESMP:\n\u2022 Distribute PIB/FAQ and make it publicly available during consultations\n\u2022 Communicate with communities on potential health and safety risks and\nmitigation measures including ERPs\n\u2022 Record of consultations will be maintained in accordance with Stakeholder\nAnalysis and Communication Plan\n\u2022 Record of incidents, accidents, near-miss, fatalities associated with the project\nwill be maintained\n152\n153\n\u2022 Records of issues raised will be maintained in accordance with project GRM\n\u2022 Monitoring to this concern will be conducted annually.\n6.7 Decommissioning Phase\n334. The solar plant facility lifespan is expected to be >20 years, at which point it might be\ndecommissioned. Typical activities during the decommissioning and site reclamation phase\ninclude facility removal, breaking up of concrete pads and foundations, removal of access\nroads that are not maintained for other uses, re-contouring the surface (if required), and land\nre-vegetation and replantation of trees. Associated impacts include erosion, noise, dust and\nvehicle exhaust, and the need to properly manage large amounts of debris, solar panels, wire\nand cabling, electronics, etc. solar plant and its power production may have a much longer\nlifespan that the solar PV plants (order of 45 to 60 years), which may be further extended\nthrough maintenance and periodic equipment replacement.\n335. The ESMP plan provides a preliminary assessment of potential mitigation\nmeasures/safeguards that may be implemented at a minimum of six months prior to plant\nclosure at that time. This will be followed by a detailed decommissioning and site reclamation\nplan to be developed at that time. The preliminary assessment will include measures for\navoiding and/or minimizing surface erosion, impact to air and water quality, noise and\nvibration, flow alteration, waste generation, impact to flora and fauna, traffic related issues as\nwell as health and safety of workers and communities.\n6.8 Cumulative and Induced Impacts\n336. In 2016, ADB conducted a preliminary grid-integration study on solar PV prospects for\nCambodia.103 The study report, issued in February 2017, demonstrates the technical feasibility\nof rapid uptake of solar power to boost generation capacity, diversify the country\u2019s energy mix,\nincrease energy security, improve system stability and avoid GHGs. The grid integration study\nlays out three scenarios of PV penetration (low, medium and high), the corresponding levels\nof electricity generation and emissions as well as impacts on the grid and recommended\nmitigation measures. The study suggests that with currently available technologies, up to 150\nMW of solar can be added to the grid by 2020 with no major impact on the grid and no\nadditional transmission investment.104 The study also suggests a staged solar PV capacity\ndevelopment plan to 2030 that would allow new systems to be added as demand grows and\ntransmission capacity expands in Cambodia.\n337. Given the above scenario, cumulative impacts could arise from other similar solar PV\nprojects in the vicinity that are being constructed concurrently with the construction stage of\nthis project. There are no existing commercial solar PV plants in operation in close proximity\nto the proposed project except the 60 MW Solar Plant developed by Schnetic in Taing Krasaing\nCommune, Toeuk Phos District and is about 40km to the proposed solar park in Kbal Toeuk\ncommune. The 10 MW Bavet solar park project in Svay Rieng province is approximately 200\nkm from the proposed site. Given the constraints in availability of information, it is only\n103 ADB. (14 February 2017) Towards a National Solar Program in Cambodia: Pre-feasibility Study Findings. Confidential Draft.\nManila.\n104 The report studies the addition of 100 MW added to the Phnom Penh region and 50 MW elsewhere throughout Cambodia.\npossible to qualitatively assess cumulative impacts.\n338. Topography and land-use: Field visits suggest that 500 ha in and around the solar plant\nsite are heavily disturbed by human activities; impacts resulting from land use change and\nfuture solar PV plants at the site are expected to be medium. However, all solar PV power\nplants will have negative impact on land use.\n339. Soils, Surface and Groundwater: When preparing sites for PV panels, some developers\nclear the entire site of vegetation, often leveling and grading the whole extent of the site. This\nmay result in soil compaction, soil disturbance and erosion and increase the sedimentation of\ncanals and/or any water bodies in the area. As solar PV plants occupy large areas, potential\ncumulative impacts could be significant if not managed properly especially if more solar PV\nplants were to be constructed and operated in the future in the surrounding wider area.\nDuring operation, PV panels require water for panel cleaning. Some facility operators may\nundertake groundwater extraction that may affect the groundwater table, excess usage and\nshortage in water availability for other users in the area. With stipulated mitigation measures\nto avoid disturbance to the soils as well as surface and groundwater usage, the cumulative\nimpacts associated with future solar PV plants in this regard are expected to be minor.\n340. Air, Noise and Vibration: Most solar PV plants will have negative impacts on air, noise\nand vibration during peak construction stage, which are temporary and localized in nature,\nthe cumulative impacts in this regard are expected to be minor. There will be no air quality\nissues during operation except for fugitive dust emissions arising from movement of transport\nvehicles on access roads. There will be some noise generation due to movement of vehicles\nand operation of substation. However, cumulative impacts during operation in this regard are\nexpected to be minor.\n341. Ecology: The biodiversity assessment confirmed that the proposed site does not\nsupport any species or habitat of conservation value. However, given the considerable space\nrequirements of commercially viable solar PV plants (100 ha) and corresponding\nsite/vegetation clearances, the effect on ecology could be significant and should be informed\nby detailed ecological assessment of the area under consideration.\n342. Human Environment: Resettlement and rehabilitation of affected persons may have\nhigher relevance for solar PV plants in cases of land acquisition of paddy fields (that also serve\nas a livelihood source for most rural communities) and associated power evacuation. However,\nwith implementation of safeguard measures such as careful site selection that avoids\nagriculturally productive lands and appropriate and timely compensation, the cumulative\nimpacts associated with solar PV plants in this regard are expected to be minor.\n343. Waste: All solar PV plant development will need to effectively manage their wastes\nsuch as biodegradable waste (vegetation clearances), construction debris, presence of\nworkers and hazardous materials, leaks and spills. In case solar PV plants utilize lithium ion\nbatteries for energy storage, then certified vendors will need to be identified for collection\nand disposal of batteries at the end of its life span. The cumulative impacts associated with\nsolar PV plants in this regard are expected to be minor if managed effectively.\n154\n155\n344. Visual and Aesthetics: Within the wider surrounding area, there are no sensitive\nhuman receptors, no sites of particular importance, visual or scenic features, environmental\nreserves or parks that will be affected by the current or future development. The nearest\ncommunity forest is approximately 5-7 km away. Another issue is the potential for glare\ncaused by sunlight reflected off the PV panels from the future developments in the wider\nproject area. PV panels work on the concept of absorbing sunlight rather than reflecting it.\nWhile minimal reflections from the panels are inevitable, this is not anticipated as a major\nissue. Thus, impacts in this regard are expected to be minor.\n345. Induced impacts would include more frequent use of major roads and access roads for\nthe transportation of workers, equipment and machinery to the solar plant site. This will result\nin traffic nuisance to nearby communes and increase in dust due to movement of vehicles and\nincrease in vehicular emissions affecting air quality. However, with mitigation measures, the\nimpacts are expected to be minor.\nCHAPTER 7: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN\n346. The 60MW Solar Plant's Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) identifies\nthe potential project environmental impacts and defines mitigation measures and monitoring\nrequirements for the design and pre-construction, construction, and operation stages of the\nproject. It also defines the institutional arrangements, roles and responsibilities of institutions\ninvolved and cost estimates for implementation of the ESMP. The ESMP will ensure\nenvironmental protection activities during all stages in order to prevent, reduce, or mitigate\nadverse environmental impacts and risks. The ESMP draws on the findings of the project ESIA\nreport and discussions and agreements with ADB, IFC and EDC.\n347. The 60MW solar plant\u2019s ESMP is based on inputs from the Feasibility Study team for\nthe project as of June\u2013July 2018, and field assessment in Sept-Nov 2020. Detailed engineering\ndesigns are referred to in this ESMP. With the oversights of PIC and EPC of EDC\u2019s National Solar\nPark, PRAC\u2019s SECU will inform the obligation of its Turnkey contractors/subcontractor to\nimplement the ESMP (Figure 22 below).\n7.1 Institutional Arrangements and Implementation Responsibilities\nFigure 22: Institutional arrangement for the NSP and the PRAC's 60 MW Solar Plant Project\nfor construction and operation periods\nTable 39: Roles and responsibilites of key units\nPRAC\u2019s 60 MW solar plant EDC\u2019s NSP PIC, & NSP EPC\nSocial and Environmental PRAC's EPC Construction and\nComplaince Unit (SECU) Engineering Unit (CEU)\nSECU will monitor the CEU will ensure their staff and NSP PIC will ensure that PRAC\ncompliance of CEU. sub-contractors follow ESMP, comply with ESMP and\nand comply with relevant relevant regulations.\n156\n\n\n--- Table on Page 169 ---\n| PRAC\u2019s 60 MW solar plant |  | EDC\u2019s NSP PIC, & NSP EPC |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Social and Environmental\nComplaince Unit (SECU) | PRAC's EPC Construction and\nEngineering Unit (CEU) |  |\n| SECU will monitor the\ncompliance of CEU. | CEU will ensure their staff and\nsub-contractors follow ESMP,\nand comply with relevant | NSP PIC will ensure that PRAC\ncomply with ESMP and\nrelevant regulations. |\n\n157\nsocial and environment\nsafegaurd policies.\nRole Responsibility\nPRAC PMO provides management support to SECU, CEU, OMU\nSECU monitor project activities to ensure continuing compliance with\nESMP during both construction and operation\nConstruction\nCEU Develops, plans and implements project activities regarding\nESMP during construction\nContractors Develop and plan activities in accordance with ESMP during\nconstruction\nSubcontractors Implement activities regarding ESMP during construction\nOperation\nOMU Develops, plans and implement project activities regarding\nESMP during operation\nO&M Contratactors Develop and plan activities in accordance with ESMP during\noperation\nO&M Subcontractors Implement activities regarding ESMP during operation\n348.

The PMO is assigned responsibility on behalf of\nPRAC, for the day-to-day management of the project. With the oversights of PIC and EPC of\nEDC\u2019s National Solar Park, the PMO will have the responsibility to supervise and oversee the\n60MW solar plant\u2019s compliance with (i) loan covenants, (ii) environmental safeguards\nrequirements, (iii) coordinate the project GRM, (iv) coordinate with line ministries to ensure\nsmooth implementation of the project, (v) supervise the procurement process and (vi) report\nto ADB/IFC. Within PMO, PRAC will appoint a team of external consultants consisting of\nenvironment officer, social officer, and HS officer (under SECU) to carry out ESMP and to\nensure compliance with the requirement of relevant regulations. See organizational structure\nin chapter 3.\n349. PRAC\u2019s contractors for 60MW solar plant. All contractors and sub-contractors will be\nresponsible for implementing the mitigation measures during construction and operation\nunder the supervision of the SECU of PRAC. To ensure that the contractors comply with the\nESMP provisions, the SECU will ensure that the safeguards requirements are met. SECU will\nwork with contractors/sub-contractors and their staff to regularly co-ordinate with affected\npersons), village chiefs and commune councils to provide up to date information on project\nactivities and to address any issues that arise during project implementation.\n350. SECU of PRAC will be responsible for overall supervision and coordination during\nproject implementation; in particular it will ensure consistency of safeguards documents with\ngovernment policy, legal and administrative framework across all jurisdictions \u2013 national, state\nand local level as well as assist with project GRM and meaningful consultations.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 170 ---\n|  | social and environment\nsafegaurd policies. |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Role | Responsibility |  |\n| PRAC PMO | provides management support to SECU, CEU, OMU |  |\n| SECU | monitor project activities to ensure continuing compliance with\nESMP during both construction and operation |  |\n| Construction |  |  |\n| CEU | Develops, plans and implements project activities regarding\nESMP during construction |  |\n| Contractors | Develop and plan activities in accordance with ESMP during\nconstruction |  |\n| Subcontractors | Implement activities regarding ESMP during construction |  |\n| Operation |  |  |\n| OMU | Develops, plans and implement project activities regarding\nESMP during operation |  |\n| O&M Contratactors | Develop and plan activities in accordance with ESMP during\noperation |  |\n| O&M Subcontractors | Implement activities regarding ESMP during operation |  |\n\n7.2 Reporting and Monitoring\n351. The SECU will be responsible for environmental reporting and ensure compliance\nchecks and environmental monitoring. SECU will prepare the project Quarterly Progress\nReports (QPR) of 60MW solar plant for submission to NSP EDC\u2019s PIC and six-month to the MoE,\nand one monitoring report during construction and annual reports during operation till the\nproject completion for ADB/IFC. Together with NSP, the environmental monitoring reports of\n60MW solar plant will be publicly disclosed on the ADB/IFC website. Reporting to ADB/IFC will\ncontinue until project completion report is prepared, one year after physical completion.\n352. The SECU of PRAC will be responsible for environmental monitoring specifically the\n60MW solar plant. Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the 60MW\nESMP.\n\u00a7 Project readiness monitoring. To be conducted by the SECU\n\u00a7 Environmental monitoring. To be conducted across all stages of project\nimplementation as described in the EMP and assessing compliance with applicable\nCambodia environmental quality standards\n\u00a7 Compliance monitoring. To be conducted by the EDC NSP PIC to verify ESMP and EMOP\ncompliance during project implementation\n353. ADB/IFC will oversee project compliance on the basis of the annual environmental\nmonitoring reports provided by SECU/PMO and site visits (generally one to two times per\nyear).\n7.3 Training and Capacity Building\n354. PRAC will engage suitably qualified and experienced employees and contractors\npossessing relevant qualifications, certifications and/or licenses to ensure project duties and\nrequirements are carried out properly. External specialists who are suitably qualified to\nsupport site employees will be engaged where there is a need for additional expertise. PRAC\nwill ensure that these consultants are suitably qualified and experienced for the Project.\n355. In line with local regulatory requirements and labour laws, PRAC will employ\nCambodian nationals to the extent possible. Locally available management and technically\nskilled personnel will be given preferential employment opportunities. There will be\ninternational professionals employed who will be expected to train and mentor local\nprofessionals in the long- term.\n356. SECU of PRAC will provide orientation to contractors/sub-contract staff and hired\nworkers. Such training will be conducted prior to mobilization on site during construction and\noperation stages. All parties involved in constructing and operating 60MW solar plant of PRAC\nmust have an understanding of the goals, methods, and practices of project environmental\nmanagement.\n158\n159\n7.4 Cost Estimates\n357. There are mitigation measures and corresponding costs:\n\u00a7 Measures that will permanently become part of the infrastructure such as re-seeding\nof sites, hedge planting, maintenance of field margins, perimeter fencing with\nadequate ground clearance for passage of wild species/animals, road signage, detailed\nengineering measures for preventing soil erosion and localized flooding (storm water\nretention pond, strengthening of drainage canals), will be included within the main\ncivil work contract costs.\n\u00a7 Measures during the construction stage (e.g. dust suppression by watering, quiet/low\nnoise machinery and equipment, PPE, etc.) as well as measures to mitigate unforeseen\nimpacts due to construction activities will need to be included in the tender\ndocuments to ensure that all contractors budget these items in their bids.\n\u00a7 Contractors will also bear all environmental monitoring costs during the operational\nstage.\n7.5 Project Reporting\n358. PRAC will undertake the following environmental and social reporting for the Project\nin accordance not only with the Cambodian Sub-decree on Environmental Impact Assessment\nProcess (1999), but also its lenders' reporting requirements:\n\u00a7 Bi-monthly monitoring report during peak construction period, and annual monitoring\nreport to during operation period to Lenders\n\u00a7 Quarterly monitoring report during construction period and annual monitoring report\nduring the operation period to NSP EDC's PIC\n\u00a7 Six-month and annual monitoring reports to be submitted to Ministry of Environment\n359. Significant findings from the environmental and social monitoring programs and\nreportable incidents and complaints logged by the incident reporting system will need to be\nreported and discussed at regular (e.g. weekly and monthly) management meetings as\nnecessary.\n7.6 Summary of 60MW solar plant\u2019s Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring\nMeasures\n360.

As required by Cambodian regulation, PRAC will contribute toward the following fund\n\u2022 Environmental Fund = $500 per year\n\u2022 Social Fund = $500 per year\n363. The toal fund from the project for the next 20 years is $20,000.\n184\n185\nCHAPTER 8: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n364. This ESIA has been prepared as per the requirements of ADB Safeguard Policy\nStatement 2009 and IFC Performance Standards 2012. This ESIA is also in line with the\nCambodian Sub-decree No.72 on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) issued on 11 August\n1999.\n365. This project is expected to have significant environmental benefits. A transition to\nclean energy sources (i.e. solar energy generation) will limit import dependence on coal and\nother fossil fuels, delay or defer construction of new coal-fired plants and reduce reliance on\nhydropower generation. This would contribute to national emission reduction targets and\nreduced pollution impacts.\n366. The total land conversion for a 60 MW solar plant is 97 ha, of which is permanent.\nSome vegetation on site will be maintained for safety reasons.\n367. The potential adverse environment impacts associated with the project have been\navoided or minimized through careful site selection of the solar park (where the 60MW solar\nplant is located). A biodiversity assessment conducted for the project confirms that there are\nno habitats or species of conservation value in the project area of influence.\n368. While climate change impacts are not anticipated to be significant over the design life\nof the 60 solar plant (+20 years), the preliminary design integrates flood resilience measures\nsuch as elevating 60 MW solar plant, strengthening existing drainage canals and building a\nstorm water retention pond. Regular maintenance of drainage canals, storm water retention\npond and access roads will be carried out to ensure their ongoing effective operation. The key\nclimate vulnerable components will be subject to further analysis during the detailed\nengineering design.\n369. The Project is not expected to cause significant adverse impacts, the identified impacts\ncan be managed through effective implementation of the mitigation measures specified in the\nESMP. Monitoring parameters have been identified to check the effectiveness of ESMP\nmeasures and to ensure any unidentified impacts can be readily addressed.\n370. The SECU/PMO of PRAC will set up a GRM and GRC as soon as the project commences\nto deal with environmental and social issues that may be raised by affected persons and other\nrelevant stakeholders during project implementation. The GRM will be coordinated by the\nSECU/PMO. GRM will address concerns and complaints promptly via transparent process.\n371. Public consultations and FGDs with project affected persons and other relevant\nstakeholders were conducted in May and July 2018. Measures to address concerns raised\nduring the consultations have been integrated in the design and ESMP. Overall, all\nstakeholders were made aware of the proposed project and were supportive due to expected\nbenefits such as local employment. Consultations with project-affected stakeholders will\ncontinue during detailed design and project implementation.\n372. The Project has been designed to minimize impacts and risk on key environmental\nvalues and social values, particularly the Praek Mkak. The Project will result in a short-term\nand spatially confined impact on the project site. Habitat (and flora) loss for project\ndevelopment is necessary and cannot be avoided. However, the loss will be partially restored\nby rehabilitation.\n373. The project will provide a significant benefit to the Kampong Chhnang and Kampong\nSpeu provinces and Cambodian economy. The project will be the largest investment in the\nprovince, and the flow on effect to the economy of this province is likely to be considerable.\nRevenues from taxes, royalties and investment will make a substantive contribution to the\ndevelopment of the Cambodian economy. With careful implementation of the proposed\nmanagement, mitigation and offset/compensation measures, the project should bring a net\nsocio-economic benefit to Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu provinces and Cambodia\nwithout compromising the integrity of the hydrology, and other socio-economic resources.\n374. It is recommended that PRAC:\n\u00a7 Strictly implement the ESMP, Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan and\napproved mitigations and monitoring measures in this ESIA at all phases of the project\ndevelopment.\n\u00a7 Cooperate with the Ministry of Environment, line ministries and local authorities to\nensure that the mitigation/monitoring measures are enforced and are participatory.\n\u00a7 Establish the Environmental and Social Fund to contribute to the further and wider\nconservation, restoration and management of the social and environmental resources\naround the project site and in Cambodia.\n\u00a7 Commit to the environmental contract and other agreements prescribed by the\nMinistry of Environment.\n375. Based on the results of the ESIA, public consultation, and the commitment of the\nproject proponent, associated losses and impacts from the project can be managed, mitigated\nand monitored to prevent, reduce and avoid the majority of impacts at all phases of the\nproject development. It is clear that the project has the full capacity and resources to protect\nthe environmental and social assets associated with implementation of the project. In\naddition, there will be economic benefits and a lasting positive legacy from the project.\n186\n187\nAPPENDIXES\nAppendix I: Project Information Booklet\n188\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\nAppendix II: Soil Test Result\n196\n197\nAppendix III: Air/Noise/Vibration Test Result (Location 1)\n(A) Air Quality\n198\n199\n(B) Noise Result\n(C) Vibration Result\n200\n201\nAppendix IV: Air/Noise/Vibration Test Result (Location 2)\n(A) Air Quality\n(B) Noise Result\n202\n203\n(C) Vibration Result\nAppendix V: List of Attendees in the Village Consultation (27 September 2020)\n204\n205\n206\n207\nAppendix VI: List of Attendees in Provincial Consultation (19 October 2020)\n208\n209\nAppendix VII: Approval Letter for TOR\nAppendix VIII: Handover Certificate of Cleared Land Mine/UXO Area\n210\n211\nAppendix IX: Detail Socio-Economic Data (see separate excel file)"

POVERTY IMPACT AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS\nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy\nThe project comprises a loan to Prime road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited for the development,\nconstruction and operation of a 60 MW alternating current (MWac) utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power project\nin Kampong Chhnang Province. The Project will contribute to the establishment of the first phase of the planned 100\nMWac Cambodian National Solar Park Project. The government will lease necessary land for the project, which was\npurchased by the government through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) sovereign loan for the establishment of\nthe larger solar park. Cambodia aims to reduce poverty among its citizens through improved electricity supply and\ncoverage. Cambodia\u2019s current policy framework for poverty reduction comprises the government\u2019s socioeconomic\npolicy agenda, the Rectangular Strategy Phase IV (2018\u20132023) and its implementation plan, the National Strategic\nDevelopment Plan, 2019\u20132023. As stated in the strategy, the national poverty reduction target is greater than one\npercentage point per year. In addition, two multi-sector strategies have poverty reduction at their core: the National\nSocial Protection Strategy for the Poor and Vulnerable and the National Food Security and Nutrition Strategy. The\nproject contributes to one of the four priority areas in the Rectangular Strategy Phase IV, namely, continued\ninvestment in energy infrastructure.a As the first utility scale solar public\u2013private partnership in Cambodia, the project\naims to expand low-cost energy infrastructure, while strengthening private sector participation in the energy sector.\nThe project is aligned with the ADB country partnership strategy for Cambodia 2019\u20132023, which aims to reduce\nincome poverty, multidimensional poverty, and poverty vulnerability, and to promote inclusive growth by focusing on\nrural areas and rural\u2013urban\u2013regional linkages.b The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which\npromotes addressing remaining poverty in developing member countries, tackling climate change and enhancing\nenvironmental sustainability, strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and catalyzing financial resources\nfor development. The project is also a significant opportunity to demonstrate a One ADB approach through ADB\u2019s\nprovision of sovereign lending, transaction advisory and project finance.\nB. Poverty Targeting:\nGeneral intervention Individual or household (TI-H) Geographic (TI-G) Non-income MDGs (TI-M1, M2,\netc.)\nA reliable, affordable and sustainable supply of energy will improve the business environment in Cambodia and\nencourage additional investment and economic growth. Cambodia\u2019s Industrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025\nrecognizes that current electricity tariffs and interrupted supply are major impediments to the competitiveness of the\ncountry\u2019s manufacturing sector and calls for alternate sources of energy to be developed. Such investment will\nprovide job opportunities, higher incomes, and improved living conditions for local Cambodians.c The project has\nthe lowest grid tied solar tariff at USC 3.877/kWh in Southeast Asia. This will help lower the electricity price in\nCambodia, which is among the highest in the region. In mid-2019, residential electricity price in Cambodia (US\u00a2\n15/kWh) is higher than in Thailand (US\u00a2 12/kWh), Indonesia (US\u00a2 10/kWh), Viet Nam (US\u00a2 8/kWh) and Bangladesh\n(US\u00a2 6/kWh).d Using ADB\u2019s sovereign financing, Electricit\u0117 du Cambodge (EDC) is constructing a solar park facility\nto accommodate up to 100 MWac of solar PV power generation capacity situated 60-70 kilometers from Phnom\nPenh, one of the main electricity demand centers in Cambodia. The Solar Park facility includes land, access road,\nsubstation, and transmission lines to connect to the grid. EDC acquired the land which will be provided to the project\nthrough a 20-year land lease agreement.\nC. Poverty and Social Analysis\n1. Key issues and potential beneficiaries. The project site and transmission line route selected by EDC were chosen\nfollowing an alternatives analysis to avoid impacts on residential and other structures, crops and trees. Power plant\nland was formerly used for commercial cassava plantation and there are no villages within 5 kilometers. Direct\nbeneficiaries are therefore land sellers, village community members that may access employment opportunities and\nEDC as off taker of electricity produced. Indirect beneficiaries include EDC customers and companies within the\nborrower\u2019s supply chain that will benefit from procurement of goods and services for the project. Community\nmembers may be constrained in accessing proposed employment opportunity because the borrower outsources\nconstruction, operation and maintenance to sub-contractors that will likely utilize in-house resources, expertise and\nservices to optimize associated costs. The solar park feasibility study impact assessment reported that in 2015 22%\nof households in Kbal Tuek commune where the power plant will be located live below the national poverty line. The\nassessment further notes that at the time, no households in Kbal Tuek commune were connected to the grid and\n61% used batteries as the primary source of electricity.\n\n\n--- Table on Page 4 ---\n| I.

Impact channels and expected systemic changes. The design, construction and operation of a solar plant provides\nlimited impact channels for the direct beneficiaries, except for employment opportunities on a renewable energy\nproject. More broadly, indirect beneficiaries such as EDC customers are expected to be able to access more\naffordable and better electricity supply through the addition of the solar plant to the grid.\n3. Focus of (and resources allocated in) the transaction TA or due diligence. The borrower will assess the\nenvironmental and social impacts of its specific project design and submit the report to ADB for approval. Due\ndiligence will additionally include development of assurance from the borrower that all commitments made by EDC\nto ADB as part of the earlier sovereign loan regarding plant site construction and operation are cascaded down and\naccepted. For instance, the solar park feasibility study undertaken by EDC highlighted high poverty incidence among\nhouseholds in the communes surrounding the power plant site and likely absence of skilled labor. EDC however\nrequires in the impact assessment that contractors use local labor for manual work and eligible local workforce for\ntechnical and administrative jobs. The terms of reference for the borrower\u2019s impact assessment therefore includes\nscope for an updated assessment of poverty incidence and skills availability. The borrower indicated in its project\nproposal that in addition to provision of employment opportunities, it plans to provide financial support for local\ncommunity development activities.\nII. GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT\n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or\nprogram? Cambodia has policies targeting renewable energy, as well as gender equality, however they are not well\nintegrated. Public-sector energy roles in Cambodia still tend to be male-dominated, with women in the sector typically\nemployed in finance and accounting departments. This is typical across the lower Mekong region, where women\nare being increasingly employed in public-sector energy organizations, though men still overwhelmingly occupy\nexecutive and management level positions.e The low literacy and education levels of women in the workforce,\ncombined with attitudes toward gender roles that emphasize the women as \u201clower status\u201d and \u201chousehold manager\u201d\nstill limit women\u2019s livelihood alternatives and opportunities for higher level occupations and decision-making\npositions.f\n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to contribute to the promotion of gender equity and/or\nempowerment of women by providing women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets,\nand participation in decision making? Yes No\nThe project comprises a loan to a Thailand based solar development company for the construction and operation of\na 60 MWac plant in a rural area. The borrower will outsource all construction and operation phase work to sub-\ncontractors and is responsible only for the supply electricity to EDC. The project team will explore project related\nopportunities with the borrower for gender mainstreaming actions within its corporate structure and in the community.\n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality?\nYes No\nThe project has not caused involuntarily displacement or livelihood impacts that would disproportionately adversely\naffect women or girls.\n4.

PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT\n1. Who are the main stakeholders of the project, including beneficiaries and negatively affected people? Identify\nhow they will participate in the project design. The main stakeholders for the government\u2019s solar park project\n(including the transmission line) were identified during the feasibility study and engaged during consultation\nmeetings in May 2018 for the impact assessment. The main stakeholders for the power plant site are households\nin villages, village leaders and commune councils. Consultation included public meetings, provision of information\nbooklets in Khmer, and focus group discussions.\n2. How can the project contribute (in a systemic way) to engaging and empowering stakeholders and beneficiaries,\nparticularly, the poor, vulnerable, and excluded groups? What issues in the project design require participation of\nthe poor and excluded? The solar park project feasibility study included extensive consultation with local government\nofficials and communities. The borrower will undertake further consultation with stakeholders as part of its impact\nassessment and per the requirements of the solar park project stakeholder engagement strategy. The strategy\nincludes a grievance redress mechanism. Due diligence will include attaining borrower assurance of implementation\nof the strategy.\n3. What are the key, active, and relevant civil society organizations (CSOs) in the project area? What is the level of\ncivil society organization participation in the project design? While no specific groups are named in the stakeholder\nanalysis as part of the solar park feasibility study, the presence of community forest protection, religious and micro-\nfinance organizations are noted. The study further identified, though did not name, non-government environment\nand natural resource conservation groups present in Kbal Teuk commune.\nInformation generation and sharing (M) Consultation (M) Collaboration Partnership\n\n\n--- Table on Page 5 ---\n| 2.

Yes No\nOngoing implementation of the stakeholder engagement strategy along with re-engagement with groups as part of\nthe borrower\u2019s impact assessment, provides adequate opportunity for participation of the poor an excluded in the\nproject planning process. There are no specific issues that directly require the participation of these groups, however\nattention will be paid during due diligence on household poverty incidence, access to electricity in households and\nskills availability in the general project area.\nIV. SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS\nA. Involuntary Resettlement Category A B C FI\n1. Does the project have the potential to involve involuntary land acquisition resulting in physical and economic\ndisplacement? Yes No The project will be built and operated on EDC-owned land leased to ADB\u2019s\nborrower. At the time of bidding the borrower estimated that it would require approximately 75 hectares of a total 91\nhectares that had been procured at that time.g EDC purchased the land on a willing-buyer willing-seller basis on\ncommercial terms at a rate mutually agreed by all parties. EDC commissioned an external independent expert (a\nlocal law form) to undertake a review of the procurement process for the plant site, which determined that\nnegotiations were free, fair, transparent and did not cause involuntary displacement impacts. The plant site land\nwas formerly used by two owners for commercial cassava plantations. The plant will export power to the national\nelectricity grid through transmission facilities to be provided by EDC. The project will interconnect with a pooling\nsubstation that will be built by EDC on EDC owned land immediately adjacent to the plant. Involuntary displacement\nimpacts have been anticipated by EDC in the construction of the dedicated 40-kilometer transmission line and a\nresettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with ADB Safeguard Policy Statement requirements.\nImplementation of the plan will be monitored by ADB\u2019s sovereign operations department. ADB\u2019s non-sovereign\nborrower will undertake an environmental and social impact assessment to assess project impacts, however, no\nadditional involuntary displacement impacts are anticipated.\n2.

How are these additional social issues and risks going to be addressed in the project design? The project will\nrequire only five skilled employees during operation (a site manager, a senior electrical engineer and three electrical\nengineers). Module cleaning and vegetation control will be undertaken on a seasonal basis and in accordance with\nweather patterns and ad-hoc events (accumulation of matter on surfaces such as soil or bird droppings). The project\npresents only limited opportunities for local employment during the 18-month construction phase and during\noperations. During due diligence the ADB team will work with the borrower to maximize the potential use of local\nworkers by contractors during construction and operation.\nVI.

ADB\u2019s non-sovereign borrower will therefore benefit\nfrom extensive project preparatory work already undertaken by ADB and EDC. The borrower will commission what\nwill essentially be an update to the solar park environmental and social impact assessment but based entirely on\nits specific design and sub-contracting arrangements for construction and operation of the power plant. ADB will\nreview and approve this impact assessment as part of its due diligence. |\n"

In Cambodia, women exercise considerable autonomy and\nindependence. They can own assets, manage financial transactions, and contribute to household\ndecision making. Both men and women can inherit property, and the gender division of labor can\nbe complementary and flexible, with men and women performing a range of productive and\nhousehold tasks. In practice, however, traditional norms and low levels of education and literacy\nstill limit girls\u2019 and women\u2019s choices and options. Cambodia remains a hierarchical society with\nstrong ideas about power and status. Women are considered to be of lower status than men,\nalthough status is also determined by age and other socioeconomic characteristics, especially\nwealth. For women, marriage and children additionally determine status. In general, attitudes\ntoward gender roles still emphasize the woman as household manager and the man as provider.\nWomen are also severely underrepresented in decision-making processes outside the household.\nGender disparities in employment remain extensive, primarily because of traditional attitudes\nabout \u201cappropriate\u201d occupations for women and men. The low literacy and education levels of\nwomen in the workforce greatly limit their livelihood alternatives and bar them from higher level\noccupations and decision-making positions.1\n2. Renewable energy sector. The policy environment on both renewable energy and\ngender equality is in place in Cambodia, however they remain separate and siloed with men\ndominating the renewable energy sector. Although women are being increasingly employed, men\nstill overwhelmingly occupy executive and management level positions with women usually\nconcentrated in the financial, administrative, human resources, and promotional aspects of\nenergy organizations. Perceptions that \u2018energy work\u2019 involves heavy labor and is not \u2018suitable\u2019 for\nwomen persist. This is in large part due to the field-based aspects of installation and repair of\npower grids that are commonly associated with masculine labor, and that traveling afar for this\npurpose pose risks to women and pull them away from their families. A number of women are\nleading renewable energy businesses (e.g., solar energy, biomass, and clean energy\ncookstoves), although their opportunities for expansion are circumscribed by persistent gender\nnorms including domestic obligations and barriers to financing.2\n3. Procurement. Globally, women-owned businesses earn less than 1% of the money spent\non products and services by large corporations and governments.3 A company which seeks to\nincrease its proportion of women-owned suppliers increases its ability to tap into local networks\nand knowledge opening the door to more innovation, greater competitiveness, and possible cost\nreductions.4\n4.
