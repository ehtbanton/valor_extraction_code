EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
1. The National Solar Park (NSP) Project of Electricite du Cambodge (EDC) involves the
contruction of two phases totaling 100-megawatt (MW) capacity in Kampong Chhnang
province and transmission connection to the Phnom Penh demand center to supply power to
the national grid. This impact assessment is for the design, construction and operation of the
first phase involving a 60 MW power plant "Project" for the NSP by a private contractor Prime
Road Alternative (Cambodia) Co. Ltd. (hereafter referred to as PRAC). This assessment is
required by lenders in their appraisal of PRAC’s proposed loan to finance the Project.
2. The NSP is the first of its kind in Cambodia and builds on lessons learnt from ADB
Private Sector Operations Department’s financing of a 10 MW solar power plant at Bavet, Svay
Rieng Province in 2016. Building on the Bavet project, the NSP aims to demonstrate the ability
of large-scale solar parks to produce solar energy at a competitive price while also providing
technical benefits to the national grid and substitute for planned fossil fuel and hydropower
generation in the future.1 The NSP will build appreciation for the costs, operational
requirements and actual performance of solar PV plants.
3. The government’s Rectangular Strategy, Phase IV (2018–2023), highlights increased
investment in solar energy to reduce electricity costs and ensure long-term energy security.2
The government has also prioritized the development of renewable energy in its National
Strategic Development Plan 2014–2018 in order to meet the growing demand for electricity
in Phnom Penh and address the country’s electrification target of 100% of villages by 2020.3
In addition, the government’s Industrial Development Policy 2015–20254 identifies the
historically high power tariffs in the country as a major impediment to the competitiveness of
the country’s manufacturing sector, and calls for alternate sources of energy to be developed.
Furthermore, Cambodia’s Nationally Determined Contribution, enshrined in the 2015 Paris
Agreement5, commits to a 16% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a business
as usual scenario by 2030 from the energy sector.6 Ideally, alternate, clean sources of energy
would complement installed and planned hydropower-based generation, which is often
inadequate during the dry season, as well as help provide ancillary benefits to the grid around
the key demand centers.
1 Technical or ancillary benefits include: (i) voltage support during peak loading periods, (ii) reduction of loading levels on
transformers, (iii) and reduction of the amount of power that needs to be generated from distant sources (hydro and coal,
in particular) and therefore reduction of losses in the transmission system.

Project Organizational Structure
4. PRAC will be responsible for project implementation and compliance for the 60 MW
solar plant loan. The PRAC’s Project Management Office (PMO) will be responsible for day-to-
day coordination specifically for its 60MW solar plant and will be the principal liaison with the
NSP’s Project Implementation Consultant (referred to as the NSP PIC). PRAC’s PMO will be
supported by the Consultant Team to be engaged to handle social and environmental issues
under its PMO’s Social and Environmental Compliance Unit (SECU). With the oversight of NSP
PIC, the SECU will be responsible for 60MW solar plant’s overall supervision and coordination
during project implementation and ensure consistency of all safeguards documents with
lender requirements, government policy, legal and administrative framework.
5. PRAC will build, own, operate and maintain the 60MW portion of the NSP and all
s
infrastructure installed under the Project, as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) with a
long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Electricity du Cambodge (EDC).
Project Location
6. The 60MW solar plant covers an area of 97 ha within the planned 250 ha NSP and is
located in Tuek Phos district of Kampong Chhnang province.
Project Impacts, Outcome and Outputs
7. The project is aligned with the Government’s stated impact of lower electricity cost in
Cambodia.7 The project outcome will be increased private sector investments in solar PV in
Cambodia.
8. Climate Resilience – A climate risk and vulnerability analysis (CRVA) of the 60 MW solar
plant is covered by the NSP study (IEE) which is classified as being at medium risk from future
climate change impacts. Based on this study, the key climate change impacts in the region
would be extreme rainfall events causing flooding and precipitation induced landslides. While
climate change impacts are not anticipated to be significant over the design life of the solar
park (+20 years) as well as the 60 MW solar plant, the preliminary design integrates flood
resilience measures such as ensuring solar park (and 60MW solar plant) are raised above the
highest flood level, strengthening existing drainage canals and building a storm water
retention pond. Regular maintenance of drainage canals, storm water retention pond and
access roads will be carried out to ensure their ongoing effective operation. Flood resilience
measures that will permanently become part of the 60 MW solar plant is included within the
design.
9. Land purchase –the PRAC will lease 97 ha for 60MW PV plant from EDC, which
reported that it purchased the land through commercial negotiations and on a willing buyer
willing seller basis.8
Lenders (ADB and IFC) and Domestic Environmental Requirements
7 Government of Cambodia. 2015. Cambodia Industrial Development Policy 2015–2025: Market Orientation and Enabling
Environment for Industrial Development. Phnom Penh.
8 One MW requires 1.5 to 2.5 ha of land; Source: Cambodia Solar Park Feasibility Study, 2018. The land requirements for
each phase are not scaled by MW; however, the total requirement for 100 MW will be met with 250 ha.
10. The 60MW solar plant requires an environmetal and social impact assessment (ESIA)
and environmental and social management plan (ESMP). The ESIA and ESMP cover
environmental and social impacts and risks in the project area of influence9 of the solar PV
plants10, as per the definitions in ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and World Bank
Group General Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) (2007), IFC Performance Standards
(2012). The ESIA and ESMP have been prepared based on the detailed design of the 60MW
solar plant.
11. The project will also comply with the Government Sub-decree No.72 on Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) issued on 11 August 1999. Full EIA (FEIA) is required for the 60 MW
solar plant construction.
Project Benefits
12. This project is expected to have significant environmental benefits. A transition to
clean energy sources (i.e. solar energy generation) will limit import dependence on coal and
other fossil fuels, delay or defer construction of new coal-fired plants and reduce reliance on
hydropower generation11.This would contribute to national emission reduction targets12 and
reduce pollution impacts.
13. The operation of a 60 MW solar PV plant will avoid approximately 84,000 tons of
carbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO2e) annually. For a lifetime, the project will contribute to the
reduction of emssions upto 1,760,000 tCO2e.
Anticipated Adverse Environmental and Social Impacts and Mitigation Measures
14. Environmental impacts were assessed for the project area of influence across all stages
of project implementation, i.e. (i) design and pre-construction stage, (ii) construction stage,
and (iii) operation stage.
15. During Design and Pre-Construction. The potential adverse environment impacts
associated with the Project have been avoided or minimized through careful site selection for
the solar plant. The migitation measures are included in the detailed engineering design.
Measures include: (i) ensuring final site to avoid sensitive receptors including protected areas,
habitats and species of conservation value, hospitals/clinics/schools and physical cultural
resources (PCRs) as well as minimizing impacts on human health, households and crops and
trees of economic value, (ii) orientations for the PRAC’s contractors about environmental
management and performance during the work; (iii) permits and clearances for the site, (iv)
integration of design features for climate risks and effective environmental management, (v)
conducting meaningful consultations, environmental baseline and seasonal surveys, and (vi)
9 For the purposes of establishing the environmental baseline and assessing the potential environmental impacts, the area
of influence for impacts from the proposed 60 MW solar plant is taken as 1-3km radius and this area is primarly assessed.
10 ADB SPS 2009 requires that assessment encompasses associated facilities that are not funded as part of the project
(funding may be provided separately by the borrower or by third parties), and whose viability and existence depend
exclusively on the project and whose goods or services are essential for successful operation of the project.
11 Cambodia now has a surplus of power generation in some hours in wet periods and at nighttime. Yet the national grid is
unable to meet daytime peak demand in high population areas such as Phnom Penh and experiences shortages during the
dry season when storage in hydropower reservoirs is limited.

iii
unexploded ordinances (UXO) clearance prior to civil works.
16. Impacts during Construction Stage: There will be temporary impacts during peak
construction such as increased noise and dust levels, vibration, traffic congestion (e.g. uses of
local routes for transport), waste generation, presence of workers at construction camps and
work sites as well as loss of vegetation, trees, plantations, orchards and/or crop damage. A
biodiversity assessment was carried out for the project; no habitats of significant conversation
value or protected species have been identified within the project area of influence.
17. Impacts during Operation Stage: There will be minor impacts during operation such as
visual impacts (industrial park in rural setting), risks to occupational and community health
and safety, water usage for PV panel cleaning, waste generation and impacts from the site.
18. Mitigation Measures: The identified potential adverse environmental impacts can be
managed through effective implementation of the ESMP. However, the main project risks
include the possible failure of the contractors to implement the environmental and social
monitoring plan (ESMP) effectively during construction and operation stages. These risks will
be mitigated by offering training and orientation on environmental and social safeguards to
PRAC’s contractors; developing and implementing site specific construction EMPs; following
appropriate project implementation mitigation, monitoring and reporting arrangements; and
adequate site supervision including audits of contractor’s environmental health and safety
(EHS) performance. Monitoring parameters have been identified in the ESMP to check the
effectiveness of ESMP measures and to ensure any unidentified impacts can be readily
addressed. The project risks will also be mitigated through inclusion of environmental
specifications in construction contracts, such as recycling and/or disposal of component parts
of solar PV plants.
Information Disclosure, Consultation and Participation
19. Public participation as part of this ESIA preparation for the 60MW solar plant included
information disclosure via distribution of project information booklets (PIB) in affected
communes during consultations, public meetings at district, and village level and focus group
discussions (FGDs) with both women and men of the affected communes. All of participants
supported the project. Main environmental concerns expressed by the participants were
related to increases in dust in the dry season, construction debris dumping during
construction and the operation stage. Measures to address these concerns have been
integrated in the design and ESMP.
Grievance Redress Mechanism
20. With the oversights of NSP’s PIC, PRAC will set up a project grievance redress mechanism
(GRM) under its SECU/PMO to document and resolve complaints from affected persons. With
the support of SECU, Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) will be created to address concerns
and complaints promptly via a transparent process. Complaints and their resolution will be
documented and reported in project progress reports, semi-annual and annual safeguard
reports to EDC/MoE/Lenders.
Key ESIA and ESMP implementation Responsibilities
21. PRAC will be responsible only for the overall supervision and coordination of the
60MW solar plant project implementation; it will ensure consistency of all safeguards
documents with government policy, legal and administrative framework across all
jurisdictions as well as assist with project GRM and meaningful consultation.
22. PRAC’s SECU will be responsible for social and environmental monitoring. With the
oversight of NSP PIC, the SECU will coordinate and interact with the PRAC’s PMO on
compliance to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) and IFC Performance Standard
requirements and with relevant government agencies and local authorities on permits and
clearances and update and finalize the ESIA and ESMP as needed.
23. PRAC’s SECU will submit monthly progress reports to PMO on Construction
Environmental Management Plans (CEMP)/EMP implementation, which will inform the
Project's progress report, semi-annual and annual safeguard monitoring reports to EDC/MoE.
24. One annunal monitoring report (AMR) during construction and annual reports
including status on the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) thereafter will be
submitted Lenders for review.
Conclusion
25. This ESIA confirmed that potential social and environmental impacts can be reduced
to acceptable levels with effective implementation of mitigation measures. Impacts for
instance soil erosion due to land clearance, traffic/noise disturbance, water quality, or
incoming workers are well identified and management measures are proposed to keep
impacts under control. The ESMP has specified mitigation measures to address identified
impacts, responsible parties, and monitoring during construction and operation. The Project
is expected to improve electricity supply and increase access to clean and reliable energy that
will encourage additional investment and economic growth. A transition to cleaner energy
sources will avoid thermal generation and imports as well as the construction of new coal-
fired plants. This would have significant environmental benefits, contributing to national
emission reduction targets and reduced pollution impacts.

2.1 Lenders Environmental Assessment Requirements
2.1.1 ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS 2009)
30. Safeguard requirements for all projects funded by ADB are defined in SPS 2009 which
establishes an environmental review process to ensure that projects undertaken as part of
programs funded through ADB loans are environmentally sound, are designed to operate in
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and are not likely to cause significant
environmental, health, or safety hazards. The SPS 2009 is underpinned by the ADB Operations
Manual, Bank Policy (OM Section F1/BP, October 2013). The policy also promotes adoption of
international good practices as reflected in the IFC’s (World Bank Group) Environmental
Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. This ESIA and EMP are intended to meet SPS 2009
requirements.
31. SPS 2009 environmental assessment requirements specify that:
• At an early stage of project preparation, the borrower/client will identify potential
direct, indirect, cumulative, and induced environmental impacts on and risks to
physical, biological, socioeconomic and cultural resources and determine their
significance and scope, in consultation with stakeholders, including affected
persons and concerned non-government organizations (NGOs). If potentially
adverse environmental impacts and risks are identified, the borrower/client will
undertake an environmental assessment as early as possible in the project cycle.
• The assessment process will be based on current information, including an
accurate project description and appropriate environmental and social baseline
data.
• Impacts and risks will be analyzed in the context of the project’s area of influence.
• Environmental impacts and risks will be analyzed for all relevant stages of the
project cycle, including preconstruction, construction, operations,
decommissioning, and post-closure activities such as rehabilitation or restoration.
• The assessment will identify potential transboundary effects as well as global
impacts.
• Assessment encompasses associated facilities that are not funded as part of the
project (funding may be provided separately by the borrower or by third parties),
and whose viability and existence depend exclusively on the project and whose
goods or services are essential for successful operation of the project.
• Assessment encompasses existing facilities and/or business activities that already
exist (for which) the borrower will undertake an environment and/or social
compliance audit, including on-site assessment to identify past or present
concerns related to impacts on the environment, involuntary assessment and
indigenous peoples. The objective of the audit is to determine if actions were in
accordance with SPS and to identify and address outstanding compliance issues.
32. ADB adopts a set of specific safeguard requirements that Borrowers or Clients are
required to meet in addressing environmental and social risks during the project preparation
2
3
and implementation. These safeguard requirements include15:
• Safeguard Requirements 1: Environment
• Safeguard Requirements 2: Involuntary Resettlement
• Safeguard Requirements 3: Indigenous Peoples
• Safeguard Requirements 4: Special Requirements for Different Finance Modalities
33. Other requirements of SPS 2009 included in the ESIA include:
• Analysis of Alternatives. There is a requirement to examine alternatives to the
project’s location, design, technology, components, and their potential
environmental and social impacts and consider the no project alternative. SPS
2009 states that this is only for projects which have ‘’significant adverse
environmental impacts that are irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented’’ i.e.,
category A projects. This does not apply to this category B projects but is included
for completion.
• Consultation and participation. The borrower/client will carry out meaningful
consultation with affected persons and other concerned stakeholders, including
civil society and facilitate their informed participation. This ESIA includes a
Stakeholder Analysis and Communication Strategy and a consultation plan to
ensure that the project affected persons, other concerned stakeholders and the
civil society can provide meaningful consultations into the project detailed design
and implementation.
• Information disclosure. Environmental information on the project will be
translated into Khmer and made available in accessible locations (e.g. project
construction field offices, commune councils local government offices, etc.) in
accordance with ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2011) and SPS (2009). The
ESIA will be disclosed on ADB’s project website (www.adb.org) prior to Board
approval, the final ESIA after detailed engineering design and safeguards
monitoring reports during implementation.
• Grievance redress mechanism. The borrower/client will establish a mechanism to
receive and facilitate resolution of project affected persons’ concerns, complaints,
and grievances about the project’s environmental (and social) performance.
• Monitoring and Reporting. The borrower/client will monitor, measure the
progress of implementation of the EMP, EMOP and safeguards tender
requirements for IPPs and report as mandated by the SPS 2009.
2.1.2 IFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (2012)
34. Performance Standard requirements for all projects funded by IFC are defined in IFC's
Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (2012) which establishes
an environmental review process to ensure that projects undertaken as part of programs
funded through IFC loans are environmentally sound, are designed to operate in compliance
with applicable regulatory requirements and are not likely to cause significant environmental,
health, or safety hazards. The IFC's PS 2012 is underpinned by the IFC's Policies and Standards.
The policy also promotes adoption of international good practices as reflected in the IFC’s
15 ADB (2009). Safeguard Policies Statement, 2009. Asian Development Bank. Manila. The Philippines
(World Bank Group) Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. This ESIA and ESMP
are intended to meet IFC's PS 2012 requirements.
35. The IFC's Environmental and Social Performance Standards in 2012 define IFC clients'
responsibilities for managing their environmental and social risks. The 2012 edition of IFC's
Sustainability Framework, which includes the Performance Standards, applies to all
investment and advisory clients whose projects go through IFC's initial credit review process
after January 1, 2012.
36. The Sustainability Framework comprises IFC's Policy and Performance Standards on
Environmental and Social Sustainability and IFC's Access to Information Policy. These policies
describe IFC's commitments, roles, and responsibilities related to environmental and social
sustainability. IFC's Access to Information Policy reflects IFC's commitment to transparency
and good governance on its operations, and outlines the Corporation's Institutional Disclosure
obligations regarding its investment and advisory services.
37. The Performance Standards are directed to towards clients, providing guidance on
how to identify risks and impacts, and are designed to help avoid, mitigate, and manage risks
and impacts as a way of doing business in a sustainable way, including stakeholder
engagement and disclosure obligations of the client in relation to project-level activities.
38. In case of its direct investments (including project and corporate finance provided
through financial intermediaries), IFC requires its clients to apply the Performance Standards
to manage environmental and social risks and impacts so that development opportunities are
enhanced. IFC uses the Sustainability Framework along with other strategies, policies, and
initiatives to direct the business activities of the Corporation in order to achieve its overall
development objectives.
39. IFC's clients are to comply with the eight Performance Standards throughout the life
of the investment.
§ Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social
Risks and Impacts
§ Performance Standard 2: Labor and Working Conditions
§ Performance Standard 3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention
§ Performance Standard 4: Community Health, Safety, and Security
§ Performance Standard 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement
§ Performance Standard 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Development of
Living Natural Resources
§ Performance Standard 7: Indigenous Peoples
§ Performance Standard 8: Cultural Heritage
40. Performance Standard 1 applies to all projects that have environmental and social risks
and impacts. Depending on project circumstances, other Performance Standards may apply
as well. Performance Standard 1 establishes the importance of (i) integrated assessment to
identify the environmental and social impacts, risks, and opportunities of projects; (ii)
effective community engagement through disclosure of project-related information and
consultation with local communities on matters that directly affect them; and (iii) the clients'
4
5
management of environmental and social performance throughout the life of the project.
41. Performance Standards 2 through 8 establish objectives and requirements to avoid,
minimize, and where residual impacts remain, to compensate/offset for risks and impacts to
workers, affected communities, and the environment. While all relevant environmental and
social risks and potential impacts should be considered as part of the assessment,
Performance Standards 2 through 8 describe potential environmental and social risks and
impacts that require particular attention. Where environmental and social risks and impacts
are identified, the client is required to manage them through its Environmental and Social
Management System (ESMS) consistent with Performance Standard 1.
42. The Performance Standards should be read together and cross-referenced as needed.
The requirements section of each Performance Standard applies to all activities financed
under the project, unless otherwise noted in the specific limitations described in each
paragraph. Clients are encouraged to apply ESMS developed under Performance Standard 1
to all their project activities, regardless of financing sources.
43. This ESIA/ESMP cover 60MW solar plant within the 97 ha immediate area. Other
shared facilities including EDC's substation, transmission line, access road, and the GS6
substation are NOT covered by this impact assessment.
2.1.3 The World Bank Group General Environment, Health and Safety Guideline (EHS)
(2007)
44. The EHS Guidelines16 contain the performance levels and measures that are generally
considered to be achievable in new facilities byexisting technology at reasonable costs.
Application of the EHS Guidelines to existing facilities may involve the establishment of site-
specific targets, with an appropriate timetable for achieving them. The applicability of the EHS
Guidelines should be tailored to the hazards and risks established for each project on the basis
of the results of an environmental assessment in which site-specific variables, such as host
country context, assimilative capacity of the environment, and other project factors, are taken
into account.
45. The Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines are technical reference
documents with general and industry-specific examples of Good International Industry
Practice (GIIP). When one or more members of the World Bank Group are involved in a project,
these EHS Guidelines are applied as required by their respective policies and standards.
46. This EHS contains key guidelines on (1) Environment, (2) Occupational Health and
Safety, (3) Community Health and Safety, and (4) Construction and Decommissioning.
47. Performance Standard 2012 requires that during the design, construction, and
operation of the project, the Borrower/Client will apply pollution prevention and control
technologies and practices consistent with International Best Practice, as reflected in
internationally recognized standards of the International Finance Corporation’s (World Bank
Group) Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (“EHS Guidelines”) and World Health
Organization (WHO). These standards contain performance levels and measures that are
16 WGB General EHS Guidelines (2007) https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/29f5137d-6e17-4660-b1f9-
02bf561935e5/Final%2B-%2BGeneral%2BEHS%2BGuidelines.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=jOWim3p
normally acceptable and applicable to projects. When host country regulations differ from
these levels and measures, the Borrower/Client will achieve whichever is more stringent. If
less stringent levels or measures are appropriate in view of specific project circumstances, the
Borrower/Client will provide full and detailed justification for any proposed alternatives that
are consistent with the requirements presented in this document. These EHS Guidelines are
adopted in the ESMP for the project such as IFC (WBG) Industry Sector EHS Guidelines for
Electric Power Transmission and Distribution (2007)17; and Environmental Guidelines on Air
Emissions and Ambient Air Quality, Noise Management, Wastewater and Ambient Water
Quality, Hazardous Material Management and Waste Management as well as Occupational
Health and Safety and Community Health and Safety (2007).
2.1.4 ADB Climate Change Commitments
48. In 2015, ADB committed itself to increasing climate financing from its own resources
to $6 billion yearly by 2020—$4 billion for mitigation in sectors such as renewable energy,
energy efficiency, sustainable transport, and urban development, and $2 billion for adaptation
in areas such as urban resilience and agriculture and land use. The $6 billion target
corresponds to around 30% of ADB’s projected corporate pipeline by 2020. In 2017, ADB
reached a record high of $4.5 billion in climate investments, a 21% increase from the $3.7
billion reached in 2016. From 2011 to 2017, ADB approved more than $25 billion for climate
financing—$21.7 billion from ADB’s own resources while leveraging over $3.4 billion from
external resources.
49. With a view to deliver stronger, better, and faster support to its Developing Member
Countries (DMCs), ADB has established its Climate Change Operational Framework, 2017–
2030 (CCOF 2030), which positions ADB to facilitate, collaboratively and proactively, a regional
shift toward a low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development path. It further provides
a framework for supporting DMCs in translating their nationally determined contribution
(NDC) aspirations into climate change action investment plans and implementing those plans.
2.2 JICA Guidelines for Environmental and Social Considerations (2010)
50. JICA, which is responsible for Japan’s ODA, plays a key role in contributing to
sustainable development in developing countries. The inclusion of environmental and social
costs in development costs and the social and institutional framework that makes such
inclusion possible are crucial for sustainable development. Internalization and an institutional
framework are requirements for measures regarding environmental and social considerations,
and JICA is required to have suitable consideration for environmental and social impacts.
51. The objectives of the guidelines are to encourage Project proponents etc. to have
appropriate consideration for environmental and social impacts, as well as to ensure that
JICA’s support for and examination of environmental and social considerations are conducted
accordingly. The guidelines outline JICA’s responsibilities and procedures, along with its
requirements for project proponents etc., in order to facilitate the achievement of these
objectives.
52. JICA recognizes the following seven principles to be very important.
17 IFC (WBG) Industry Sector Guidelines for Electric Power Transmission and Distribution
6
7
a. A wide range of impacts must be addressed.
b. Measures for environmental and social considerations must be implemented from
an early stage to a monitoring stage.
c. JICA is responsible for accountability when implementing cooperation projects.
d. JICA asks stakeholders for their participation.
e. JICA discloses information.
f. JICA enhances organizational capacity.
g. JICA makes serious attempts at promptness.
53. For project categorization, JICA classifies projects into four categories according to the
extent of environmental and social impacts, taking into account an outline of project, scale,
site condition, etc.
a. Category A: Proposed projects are classified as Category A if they are likely to have
significant adverse impacts on the environment and society. Projects with
complicated or unprecedented impacts that are difficult to assess, or projects with
a wide range of impacts or irreversible impacts, are also classified as Category A.
These impacts may affect an area broader than the sites or facilities subject to
physical construction. Category A, in principle, includes projects in sensitive
sectors, projects that have characteristics that are liable to cause adverse
environmental impacts, and projects located in or near sensitive areas.
b. Category B: Proposed projects are classified as Category B if their potential
adverse impacts on the environment and society are less adverse than those of
Category A projects. Generally, they are site-specific; few if any are irreversible;
and in most cases, normal mitigation measures can be designed more readily.
c. Category C: Proposed projects are classified as Category C if they are likely to have
minimal or little adverse impact on the environment and society.
d. Category FI: Proposed projects are classified as Category FI if they satisfy all of the
following requirements: JICA’s funding of projects is provided to a financial
intermediary or executing agency; the selection and appraisal of the sub-projects
is substantially undertaken by such an institution only after JICA’s approval of the
funding, so that the sub-projects cannot be specified prior to JICA’s approval of
funding (or project appraisal); and those sub-projects are expected to have a
potential impact on the environment.
54. For impact assessment, the impacts to be assessed with regard to environmental and
social considerations include impacts on human health and safety, as well as on the natural
environment, that are transmitted through air, water, soil, waste, accidents, water usage,
climate change, ecosystems, fauna and flora, including trans-boundary or global scale impacts.
These also include social impacts, including migration of population and involuntary
resettlement, local economy such as employment and livelihood, utilization of land and local
resources, social institutions such as social capital and local decision-making institutions,
existing social infrastructures and services, vulnerable social groups such as poor and
indigenous peoples, equality of benefits and losses and equality in the development process,
gender, children’s rights, cultural heritage, local conflicts of interest, infectious diseases such
as HIV/AIDS, and working conditions including occupational safety. Items to be addressed in
the specific project are narrowed down to the needed ones through the scoping process.
55. In addition to the direct and immediate impacts of projects, the derivative, secondary,
and cumulative impacts as well as impacts associated with indivisible projects will also be
assessed with regard to environmental and social considerations, so far as it is rational. The
life cycle impact of a project period is also considered.
2.3 Cambodian EIA requirements
56. The following regulations and guidelines manage and require environmental impact
assessment in Cambodia:
§ Law on Natural Resource Management and Environmental Protection (1996) highlights
the requirement for environmental impact assessment for both state and private
projects (Article 6 & 7, Chapter 3).
§ Sub-decree on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process No. 72 (1999) provides
the detailed guidelines for implementation of the EIA process and specifically that
power plants that generate more than 5 MW require an IEIA or EIA.
§ Declaration on Guideline for Conducting IEIA and EIA Reports No. 376 (2009) specifies
the basic contents of IEIA/EIA Reports, which should include: (i) introduction, (ii) legal
framework, (iii) project description, (iv) description of the existing environment, (v)
public participation, (vi) assessment of and mitigation measures for significant
environmental impacts, (vii) environmental management plan, (viii) cost-benefit
analysis, and (ix) conclusion and recommendations.
57. The MoE through its EIA Department regulates and monitors the EIA process. The MOE
is responsible for: (i) review and approval of IEIA/EIA reports in collaboration with other
relevant ministries and (ii) monitoring the ESMP implementation of Project
Proponents/Owners throughout the different project stages. The MOE operates at the
municipal and provincial levels through its Provincial Departments of Environment (PDOE).
58. The Project Proponents/Owner (public or private) is required to submit the necessary
project document (IEIA/EIA Reports) to the MOE for review and approval. After submission of
IEIA/EIA report, it will take a maximum of 30 working days for a decision.
59. The MoE's Prokas on Classifying Development Projects for ESIA in 2018 has indicated
that any power project producing more that 10MW required ESIA for MoE to review and
approve prior to any construction and operation. Therefore, ESIA is required for the 97-ha
Solar Plant Project and Terms of Reference (ToR) was submitted and approved in September
2020.
2.3.1 National Environmental Legislations
60. The Environment Law has the following objectives:
§ Protect and upgrade environmental quality and reduce pollution
§ Assess the impacts of proposed projects before approval
§ Ensure rational and sustainable use of the Kingdom’s resources
§ Encourage public participation in environmental protection and natural resource
management
§ Reduce activities that impact negatively on the environment

Communication was submitted to UNFCCC in October 200224 and November 201525,
respectively. The Second National Communication contained information on the country’s
major source of GHG emissions and sinks, vulnerability, adaptation options and mitigation
measures that Cambodia has implemented or intends to implement to further contribute to
global efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Furthermore, Cambodia’s Nationally Determined
Contribution (NDC) enshrined in the 2016 Paris Agreement26, commits to a 16% reduction in
GHG emissions from a business as usual scenario by 2030 from the energy sector.27 The
National Strategic Development Plan (2014-2018) states the importance of implementing
Cambodia’s Climate Change Strategic Plan (2014-2023) and contains indicators to track
implementation of climate change actions. In alignment to the Climate Change Strategic Plan
of Cambodia, Sectoral Climate Change Strategic Plans and Action Plans have also been
developed.

CHAPTER 3: DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
3.1 Rationale
67. Country Background. Cambodia’s economy has grown quickly over the past decade,
averaging annual growth of 7.0% from 2006 to 2016 and poverty has fallen substantially, from
47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2014.28 Nonetheless, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita,
estimated at $1,427 in 2017, remains among the lowest in Asia. An underdeveloped energy
sector is a key constraint to the further improvement of Cambodia’s economic
competitiveness and the welfare of its people. Cambodia’s energy sector is faced with several
strategic challenges. Access to reliable energy is the most pressing one in the short and
medium term while broader and longer-term issues of energy security, affordability and
environmental sustainability also need to be addressed. Nearly 5 million Cambodians do not
have access to electricity and are reliant on batteries, wood and other traditional fuels for
energy. Historically, the high cost of power, dependence on conventional energy sources and
limited transmission and distribution networks, coupled with intermittent power supply, have
hindered economic competitiveness and discouraged private sector investments. Annual
electricity demand growth in Cambodia averaged 16% from 2011 to 2017. In 2017,
Cambodia's energy consumption was 8,073 gigawatt-hour (GWh), of which 44% was coal, 34%
hydro, 4% diesel, less than 1% renewables and 18% power imports from neighboring countries.
The hydropower and coal-fired plants are owned by the private sector and operated under
long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with take-or-pay arrangements. The current
Power Development Plan (PDP), revised in 2015, projects demand growth to average about 7%
through 2030.
68. The government’s Rectangular Strategy, Phase IV (2018–2023), highlights increased
investment in solar energy to reduce electricity costs and ensure long-term energy security.29
The government also prioritized the development of renewable energy in its National
Strategic Development Plan, 2014–2018 to meet growing demand for electricity in Phnom
Penh and address the country’s electrification target of 100% of villages by 2020.30 In addition,
the Government’s Industrial Development Policy 2015–202531 identifies the historically high
power tariffs in the country as a major impediment to the competitiveness of the country’s
manufacturing sector and calls for alternate sources of energy to be developed. Furthermore,
Cambodia’s Nationally Determined Contribution, enshrined in the 2016 Paris Agreement32
commits to a 16% reduction in GHG emissions from a business as usual scenario by 2030 from
the energy sector.33 Ideally, alternate, clean sources of energy would complement installed
and planned hydropower-based generation, which is often inadequate during the dry season
as well as help provide ancillary benefits to the grid around the key demand centers.

69. PRAC will construct a 60 MW capacity solar plant in Kampong Chhnang province and
connect to the EDC substation within the NSP. EDC will construct the 40 km 230 kV overhead
transmission line from the common substation within the NSP to the existing GS6 substation
located in Odong district in Kampong Speu province34.
70. The NSP project is the first of its kind in Cambodia and builds on lessons learnt from
ADB Private Sector Operations Department’s financing of a 10 MW solar PV plant at Bavet,
Svay Rieng province in 2016. The NSP project aims to demonstrate the ability of large-scale
solar parks to produce solar energy at a competitive price while also providing technical
benefits to the national grid and substitute for planned fossil fuel and hydropower generation
in the future 35. This NSP project will build appreciation for the costs, operational requirements
and actual performance of solar PV plants.
3.2 National Solar Park Project Structure
71. The National Solar Park project combines the five components under the oversight of
EDC. According to the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), PRAC’s responsibility is to develop,
construct and operate the 60 MW solar plant (phase 1) whereas EDC will provide the NSP
shared facilities. These shared facilities include:
1. Access road: EDC is designing and selecting the aliganment for the access road. Once
completed, this road will be the shared facility for NSP. The identified road will be
upgraded and constructed in order to ensure that the mobilization of heavy equipment
and manpower to be used for construction and operation phase.
2. EDC substation: 22kV/115 kV substation to be located on 5 ha inside the total 102 ha
area of NSP phase 1. The Interconnection point which is the end of PRAC’s IPP scope
will be located in the EDC substation.
3. Transmission line: 230 kV transmission line (double circuit, 40 km in length,) that will
be initially operated at 115 kV voltage to connect the NSP from the EDC substation
with the GS6 substation in Phnom Penh.
4. Upgrading of GS6 substation: Upgrade of Grid Substation 6 (“GS6") to accomodate
solar-generated electricity from the NSP.
72. The environmental and social impacts of the shared facilities were assessed by a
separate study conducted by EDC.
73. As indicated on Figure 1, infrastructure highlighted in red are under the responsibility
of PRAC as an IPP. The infrastructure shown in green fall within the scope of EDC.
34 The project is included in ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2018–2020. Manila.
35 Technical or ancillary benefits include: (i) voltage support during peak loading periods, (ii) reduction of loading levels on
transformers, (iii) and reduction of the amount of power that needs to be generated from distant sources (hydro and coal,
in particular), and therefore reduction of losses in the transmission system.

3.4 Project Impact, Outcomes and Outputs
76. The implementation of the NSP is aligned with the Government’s stated impact of
lower electricity cost in Cambodia.36 The NSP phase 1 will be implemented based on 102 ha
of project’s land according to the Letter of Authorization issued by EDC to the Borrower on 27
August 2020. PRAC will construct a 60 MW solar plant in Kampong Chhnang Province. Under
the PPA, PRAC will construct the solar plant on 97 ha of the phase 1 project land. The
remaining 5 ha of land will be allocated for the construction of EDC’s substation.
77. The Commercial operation date of the 60 MW solar plant is anticipated to occurr in
June 2022. The project is aligned with the direction from Ministry of Mines and Energy which
is to encourage exploration and development of environmentally and socially acceptable
energy resources needed to supply all sectors of Cambodian economy.37 In addition, the 60
MW solar plant will create employment during the construction and operation.

Pre-feasibility Study out of which three were identified as preferred sites for further
assessment during the project preparatory technical assistance phase. All of the sites are
located between Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu provinces. Out of the three preferred
sites, two were dropped from further study mainly due to potential socio-economic impacts
and ease and cost of land acquisition. For details refer to Section 3.9, Chapter 3 of this ESIA.
EDC further determined that the optimal point of connection of the proposed solar park site
(initially referred to as site 6) to the national grid is at GS6. GS6 is located close to the major
load center of Phnom Penh. Connecting the new NSP substation at the solar park site to GS6
will minimize the need for EDC to build new infrastructure, provide voltage support and
reduce network losses.
79. One natural stream (i.e. Preak Mkak) to the west of the 60 MW solar plant will be
conserved. The small creek running through the plant site (land that is privately owned) will
be modified as an internal drainage. The proposed 60 MW solar plant is also situated outside
the historical flood zone. Detailed engineering design of the 60 MW solar plant integrates
measures based on recommendations from the hydrological study to maximize flood
resilience and minimize impacts on local drainage patterns. Details on hydrology and flood
risks are provided in Chapter 4 of this ESIA.
80. Common infrastructure within the 60 MW solar plant includes perimeter fencing with
adequate ground clearance (for passage of animals/wild species), drainage design and/or
building storm water retention pond. There is an existing paved road up to the start of the 60
MW solar plant (width 30 m) was built by the local Army; this approach road connects Road
No. 132/52.
81. Shared access roads to the site (length 3-4 km, width 5.5 m) will be constructed and
maintained for transportation of the equipment, materials and machinery and further
maintained during operation of the NSP by EDC.
3.5.2 Project basic layout and 60 MW solar plant design
(A) Project system summary as of October 2020
82. Conceptually, the solar plant is planned to be equipped with 535 Watt-peak
monocrystalline bifacial photovoltaic modules (PV module) for the generation of electricity
from sunlight. The total DC installed capacity is envisaged to be 78 MW-peak comprising of
164,248 PV modules. The PV modules will be installed on the East-West single-axis tracking
system which mounted on foundation which designed accordingly to the geotechnical
properties of the project’s land, taking into account the loads from PV modules, mounting
structures and wind loads. The plant is composed of (i) 20 subsystems, each subsystem has a
3150k VA Box – Transformer; (ii) 175kW string inverter total 343 sets; (iii) 475Wp
monocrystallin photovoltaic module, the PV module size is 2119 x 1038 x 35MM. The plant
will use a total number of PV modules is 164,248 PCS, and the total capacity of 78.0178Wp.
Total 3 weather stations will be constructed.
83. The PV modules will be connected to increase it voltage and form PV strings which will
be connected to 175 kW String inverter in order to convert direct current electricity generated
from solar power to alternate current electricity. The output from each string inverter is then
connected to the box transformer station in order to increase its output voltage from low
voltage to medium voltage at 22 kV for the distribution to the Interconnection point. The box
transformer comprises of low voltage input collection part, 22 kV step-up transformer and 22
kV switchgear. There will be 20 box transformer installed to collect output from the string
inverter installed at the different part of the project lands. The output from each of the box
transformer will be connected to each other, forming a 22 kV ring main system. The four (4)
output of 22 kV ring main system (each comprising 20 MW output) will be connected to the
Interconnection point at EDC’s substation via underground cable (from the nearest box
transformer to the Interconnection point). The Interconnection Point is at four (4) of 22 kV
incoming feeders of EDC substation. The revenue meter also installed at the Interconnection
Point. This is the end of PRAC’s scope of work as IPP.
84. Weather stations to be installed on-site are important for the verification of system
performance during commissioning, testing and also during the operational period. In
addition, weather data such as wind speed is also crucial for the safe operation of single-axis
tracking as well. The sensors to be installed at the solar plant includes pyranometers to
measure solar resource on front and rear side of PV module, temperature sensors to measure
ambient and PV module temperature, wind speed, rainfall and humidity sensors.
85. Lighting Protection System. This project will use Early Stream Emission (ESE) system
to prevent the damages due to lighting strike. Considering the maximum elevation of PV
module is 3 meters, the ESE for the PV installation area which lighting rod is designed to be 8
meters height which will cover radius of 89 meters. The 50 lightning rods will be installed in
the PV installation area. The Lighting Protection System (LPS) will also be provided for the
main components of the solar plant. All metal parts of the solar plant equipment shall be
earthed to provide equipotential bonding, Surge Protection Device (SPD) will be installed in
the important circuit of the electrical equipment.
86. String inverter. String inverters are installed near to the solar module support structure.
Metal shell will be connected to the earthing grid via grounding cable. The inverter forms an
equipotential object with the earthing system. Consider the inverter as the major power
generation device, every circuit of the DC and AC side has installed one SPD to protection
internal component from the indirect lightning damage.
87. Box transformer. The MV transformer, 22 kV switchgear and Low Voltage LV cabinet
are installed in one prefabricated container, and the container is provided with at least two
grounding points. The grounding points are reliably connected to the main earthing grid via
grounding cable and used for guiding lightning energy into the ground. In addition, lightning
arresters are also arranged in the 22 kV switchgear of box transformer, while the LV side is
arranged SPD to protect against the indirect lightning damage. The cooling oil type for
transformer is mineral oil which is PCB free.
88. Solar module and support structure. The solar module frame is used as the natural air-
termination and connected to the support structure via grounding cable as the natural down-
conductor. The support structure is connected to the main earthing grid via grounding cable
to form a complete grounding system. Meanwhile the internal part of single axis tracker has
been connected via grounding cable, including the connection between slew and post, slew
20
21
and damper, control box and post, all the tracker are connected as an equipotential object,
refer to the following figure.
89. The project will construct a fire path break around the project boundary to prevent
forest fires from reaching the solar plant and other facilities. There will be equipment ready
for fire-fighting (e.g. water trucks with water cannons) and train personnel to respond to forest
fires in the Project area.

3.5.3 Plots sizing and capacity options
91. The land requirements have been defined to provide the PRAC with sufficient land to
optimize the potential plant configurations for the cheapest energy price possible. The
following plant parameters were used to define land size:
• DC/AC ratio between nominal output power of solar modules (DC) and solar inverters
(AC)
• Distance between the rows and tilt (for fixed-tilt mounting systems)
• Ground Cover Ratio (GCR) for single-axis tracked systems
• Module wattage
92. In consideration of the above, the area requirements have been defined. They have
been conservatively determined to provide enough room to PRAC for optimizing the above
listed parameters.
3.5.4 Stormwater management and drainage
93. Soil test results are included as Appendix II.
94. Utilizing the abovementioned studies, the 60 MW solar project will be equipped with
the:
1. Flood protection system to prevent overflowing water from the stream at the
western side of the 60 MW solar plant project.
2. Internal drainage system for the internal water catchment, collection from all areas
and conveying into the retention pond.
3. Retention pond and discharge channel, the collected water is retained until the
water reach certain limit and therefore safely discharge to the external water
channel can be done through the discharge channel.
95. One main drainage canal will be constructed as part of the 60 MW solar plant to
provide an adequate drainage system for the PV site. It will head southwards through the
centre of the site. The length of this canal depicted in the canal layout (see Figure L, M above).
PRAC will construct the internal drainage system to mitigate flood hazards, using the main
canal for water evacuation. Retention ponds tocollect water internally inside the 60 MW solar
plant project will be built before safe release to the discharge point which leads to the
reservoir located south of the National Solar Park. The water collected in the retention pond
also can be filtered and purified for the cleaning the solar panels if it is required.

3.5.5 Amenities and facilities
96. Water consumption: During the construction stage, the main water consumption
includes 2 parts:
• The water for concrete mixing and concrete curing is more or less 180L/m³, there are
about 3,069 m³ concrete which is planing to be used at site, so the water consumption
is about 553m3 (i.e. 180*3,069), and the water consumption for concrete curing is
about 200m3. In total, there are 553 + 200 = 753m3.
• The domestic water in the construction stage for one person is about 40L-50L/day,
during the peak construction stage, there are 60-100 person who are working at site
at same time. The water consumption for one year is about 876-1,825m3.
97. During the operation and maintenance period, the main water consumption includes
2 parts:
• (1) Cleaning PV panels. During the operation and maintenance period, 5m3 water is
required for each MW PV panel cleaning, 390m3 is required for 78MW PV panel
cleaning one time. There will be four times/year, which requires 1,560m3 water for
cleaning PV panels.
• (2) Domestic water. In the maintenance stage, domestic water for one person is about
40L-50L/day, and the number of operation and maintenance personnel in peak period
is about 10-15 persons, and the water consumption for one year is about 144-270m3.

O&M Panel cleaning 1,560 m3 390 m3/time
Domestic – no include 270 m3 0.7 m3/day

98. Water sources: The water consumption during the construction period is
approximately 1,629m3-2,578m3 which is more than the consumption during operation and
O&M period. Considering a one-year construction period, the daily water consumption is
approximately 7m3. It is proposed to source water from local water service providers around
the project site. Tanked water will be the main source for both construction and operation
phases. As confirmed by the Royas village chief, there are some private water suppliers who
can truck water into the project site with the amounts required. The source of such tanked
water is from Anlong Chrey dam or reservoir (not from groundwater) where the suppliers will
need to get permission38 from local authorities before pumping and selling the water to the
project. The amount the supplier can support is 8m3 or more per day depending the
negotiation. The supply is sufficient for the construction which 2,920m3 can be trucked into
the project site, and even more sufficient for operation period. Buying such water requires
the PRAC to record the amount bought from supplier and report to Kampong Chhnang
38 PRAC talked to the supplier and confirmed that the supplier would request permission/ a permit from the commune chief
and local in-charge district office prior to pumping and selling water from Anlong Chrey dam to the project. PRAC does not
need to get any permit to buy the water from the supplier.

Department of Water Resource and Meteorology39. In combination, stormwater will be
collected during wet season for reuse during the construction and maintenance periods.
Stormwater will be treated and tested prior for cleaning the PV panels. Stormwater runoff
will be collected by drainage system and retention ponds. There are already water
reservoirs/ponds at site which can be reinforced and used to store water for panels cleaning.
99. To store stormwater, the two existing ponds could carry the storage capacity of 1)
12,759m3 (pond 1 size: 4,250m2 x 3m depth) and 2) 18,750m3 (pond 2 size: 6,250m2 x 3m
depth) whose quantity could serve the project needs during the dry season. The Project will
modify these surface water storages to enhance their capacities.
Pond 1: 4,250m2 and 3m depth Pond 2: 6,250m2 and 3m depth
Pond 1 Location (X=433724, Y=1303777) Pond 2 Location (X=433566, Y=1303369)
100. In the future, borehole and use of groundwater will be potential for the uses during
construction and operation. A detailed assessment will be conducted by PRAC to confirm the
impacts of using it prior to any extraction and PRAC will comply with any related regulations
for the permit to use groundwater. However, it was confirmed from the field investigation that
there is no borehole located in the project site. A borehole was found at a household
homestead, about 2km away from the Plant site, and the water availability from this borehole
was sufficient for domestic uses for both wet and dry seasons. Based on Cambodian Ministry
of Rural Development's guideline for clean water supply, a borehole is used for 25-30 rural
households. It is estimated that each household may consume at least from 0.25-0.5m3 per
day (i.e. each person consumes 40-50L/d) and approximately 7.5m3 per month per household.
The field investigation further indicated that the villagers' boreholes served year-round, but
groundwater was reported to be lower during the dry season, but not to the lowest that could
not be extracted.
101. The extraction of groundwater for the project, rather than vital human needs (i.e.
drinking, washing, bathing and other domestic purposes including watering for animal
husbandry, fishing and the irrigation of domestic gardens and orchards) will require a license
from the Ministry of Water Resource Management and Meteorology40.
39 The Director requests that the project shall record the amount of water uses and share it with the Department for archive.
40 Law on Water Resource Management (2007), Article 11: Every person has the right to use water resources for his/her
vital human need including drinking, washing, bathing and other domestic purposes including watering for animal

102. During operation stage, panel cleaning water will evaporate naturally after cleaning
which doesn't need to be recycled.
103. Groundwater and river water quality have been analysed to design and build water
catchment and treatment system necessary for providing water suitable for the module
cleaning process.
3.5.6 Proposed land use and preparation
104. The break-down of the indicative land use below is calculated for a 60 MW fixed-tilt
(with 1.2 ha/MW, 1.3 DC/AC ratio) and a 60 MW single-axis tracked system (with 2 ha/MW,
1.3 DC/AC ratio) of non-rectangular shape. For a fixed-tilt system, the numbers are different
as the mounting structure can be adapted more cost-efficiently to irregular shapes.41
105. Ninety-seven hectares of land within the NSP will be leased from EDC during the entire
power purchase agreement period. The Project’s land will be utilized accordingly to below
table.

husbandry, fishing and the irrigation of domestic gardens and orchards, in a manner that will not affect other legal right
of others amount not exceeding that necessary to. The fore-mentioned uses are not subject to the licensing.
Article 12: The diversion, abstraction and use of water resources for purposes other than those mentioned in Article 11,
and the construction of the waterworks relating thereto, are subject to a license or permit.
Article 20: Any person carries out drilling or digging of the wells for the professional or commercial purposes shall supply
the MOWRAM with a detailed report on the drilling or digging operation, the technical specifications and other
information. The utilization of the ground-waters and aquifers for the professional or commercial purposes the quantity
of which exceed the level as defined in Article 11 shall be subject to licensing. The no-drilling or digging zones shall be
defined in the Government Sub Decree.
41 The reason is that motors for tracked systems are dimensioned for specific table lengths. Adapting too many tracker tables
to the irregular shape of the power plant area will lead to over-dimensioning of overall motor capacity installed and hence
higher relative costs.

107. As part of the Scope of Work, PRAC will provide the fencing and security systems for
the 60 MW solar plant project according to the conceptual engineering design above.
3.5.7 Construction and logistics for PV power plants
108. The construction of the PV power plant will require access for heavy-duty transport for
the equipment, infrastructure and housing for the construction workers and engineers as well
as access to electricity and water, as elaborated in following table.

3.9 Analysis of alternatives
3.9.1 Site Selection
121. Based on the IEE (2018-19) for NSP, preliminary site evaluation was based on
assessment of seven individual sites identified by EDC42, and followed by field visits in May
and July 2017. Site 6 was identified as the preferred site for the solar park.
122. Some sites were excluded due to potential socio-economic impacts and ease and cost
of land acquisition followed by other criteria such a unsuitable terrain and vulnerability to
flooding (a key concern in Cambodia given the seasonal flood pattern). For example:
§ Site 1 is close to a cemetery and urban areas. Land acquisition costs will be high and
the potential social impacts more significant than at other sites. The site is also small,
limiting scope for future potential expansion of the initial park (the initial 100 MW
42National Solar Park Project for Cambodia: Pre-Feasibility Study, August 2017
54
55
solar park requires a land area of 150-250 hectares, assuming 1.5-2 hectares per 1 MW
of installed capacity). Therefore, it was dropped from further evaluation.
§ Site 2 is located about 10km from GS6 where the land price is also very expensive. In
addition, EDC noted that it would make little sense to build a new substation and
transmission line from the site to GS-6 for such a short distance and that, if a site close
to GS6 is to be used, it would be more economic to select Site 1 which is adjacent to
GS6 and would avoid these infrastructure investment costs. Therefore, it was dropped
from further evaluation.
§ Site 3 is opposite a primary school and next to a reservoir. It is located along national
road 44, about 35-40km from GS6 (straight line distance) where the land price is
considered medium to high. The site size of 205 hectares may also be too small and
constrain possible future expansion of the solar park. The land may be suitable for an
agro-plantation and land preparation appears to already have taken place on parts of
an Economic Land Concession (ELC) within the site, which will further raise the cost
and complexity of land acquisition. Therefore, it was dropped from further evaluation.
§ Sites 4, 5 and 7 are mostly occupied by scrubland with scattered grown trees and palm
trees. Land values are assessed as being much lower than for Sites 1, 2 and 3. The
number of landowners with land-based livelihoods is also expected to be low,
minimizing social impacts. However, EDC recommended dropping site 4 while further
preliminary technical and socio-economic assessment43 resulted in dropping site 7
from evaluation and keeping site 5 as back up.
3.9.2 Technology Selection
123. PV Module Technologies: A number of PV module technologies were assessed for use
in the project, and selection was based on minimum environmental impacts and disposal
method and procedures as follows:
§ Crystalline Modules: Most manufacturers of crystalline modules have a performance
guarantee of 25 years however; these panels can have a longer lifetime if maintained
properly. Crystalline modules pose little to no risk to the environment in terms of
toxicity since most of the module is made of common construction materials such as
tempered glass and aluminum. Furthermore, the PV cell is made from silicon, which is
a common earth element. Some panels contain a small amount of lead however; it is
sealed in a panel to reduce the risk of environmental release44. Even though these
modules do not pose a significant environmental risk, they should be recycled. PV
Cycle is an organization of PV module manufacturers that collects and recycles PV
modules within the EU with the costs of these services included in the selling price of
the modules45. In 2016, PV Cycle extended its collection and recycling service to
include Japan46. The waste management solution is also offered to other countries
outside of the EU however; an additional fee may be required for services. Recycle
Solar is another option for PV recycling. The company recycles damaged or defect PV

46 http://www.pvcycle.org/press/pv-cycle-launches-take-back-and-recycling-service-in-japan/
modules of all types in the UK and Ireland47.
§ CdTe Thin Film Modules: CdTe modules also have a warranty of 25 years.48 The
modules contain small amounts of cadmium, which is a toxic heavy metal. Tests have
shown that in the event that these panels are damaged, only a negligible amount will
be leached from the panel. Also, in the event of a catastrophic event such as a fire, the
release of cadmium is below human health evaluation levels.49 Recycling of CdTe
modules is the best option after decommissioning due to the potential release of
cadmium into the environment. First Solar, a leading CdTe module manufacturer, has
a take-back policy to pay for collecting and recycling modules at the end of their life
cycle.50
§ CIGS Thin Film Modules: CIGS modules typically have a shorter lifetime than other PV
module technologies. These cells consist of copper, indium, gallium and selenium,
which are all not considered to be very toxic elements. However, the potential
formation of hydrogen selenide from selenium is a concern because it is a carcinogen.
Also, some cells contain a thin layer of cadmium, which is toxic to the environment.
The release of these compounds into the environment is not a significant risk when
the panels are in normal use however; special disposal is required at the end of the
product life. For recycling, CIGS modules can be collected through programs such as
PV Cycle.
124. For the purpose of this 60 MW solar plant project, bifacial monocrystalline modules
will be utilized in the solar PV plants. For end of life/failure or at decommissioning, provision
in tender agreements with suppliers/vendors will ensure proper and safe collection, recycling
and/or disposal, as needed.

CHAPTER 4: DESCRIPTION OF THE BASELINE ENVIRONMENT
4.1 Assessment Methodologies
126. World Bank/IFC51 and the ADB SPS requires baseline data to be collected for the ESIA
which includes relevant physical, biological, and socio-economic conditions; which are like
what is stated in the 2009 IEIA/EIA preparation guideline by Cambodian MOE. The Cambodian
guidelines mention that a Full ESIA shall describe physical -resources, biological environment
and socio-economic resources, based on both primary and secondary data available within
and around project area to determine, predict and analyze possible environmental and social
impacts caused by project activities in order to take measures to minimize negative impacts
and maximize positive impacts. The scope of the study is defined as follow:
127. Spatial: The study covers a total land area of 97ha. The study will cover areas outside
the project boundary, but not farther than 3 km radius from the palnt site. Certain issues like
wildlife migration, water quality, and impacts on health at downstream village and natural
resource-based livelihood will be assessed.
128. Temporal: The ESIA report is prepared to cover different phases of the project, which
include: (i) design phase and preparation/construction phases, (ii) operation phase, and (iii)
decommissioning phase. Baseline information was collected only one time; however, existing
available data and information, especially from the project proponent (any relevant studies
conducted for the NSP), were collected and documented in the report.
4.2 Geographical Location
129. Overall, EDC has already aquired the 97 ha for the 60MW solar plant and all land titles
have been being coverted into one-single tenure and will be expected to complete prior to
March 2021 (see Figure 3 below).
130. The proposed project site is geographically situated between 11.669518° and
11.804790° north latitudes and 104.334288° and 104.699287° east longitudes in the
provinces of Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu in Cambodia, located northwest and west
of capital Phnom Penh, respectively. The north border of Kampong Chhnang lies on the banks
of the Tonle Sap Lake. Kampong Chhnang province is connected to the capital by National
Road No. 5 at a distance of 91 km. Kampong Chhnang province has a population of over
504,234 persons and a population density of 86 persons per square km. The project is located
only in Tuek Phos district in Kampong Chhnang province and closely to Thpong and Odongk
districts in Kampong Speu province. There is only one project affected commune – Kbal Tuek
in Kampong Chhnang province.
131. The site is located at a distance of between 3 – 6 km to the closest upgraded road.
There are no tarmac or gravel roads leading to the site. Existing bumpy roads/trails might need
to be broadened, cleared and reinforced to allow for heavy-duty transport. It is likely that the
construction of a completely new all-weather access road is required.

Figure 3: Predefined and extended land map
4.3 Project area of influence
132. The project area of influence includes localized impacts arising from noise, vibration
and dust and trans-boundary impacts with wider geographical impacts, such as GHG
emissions associated with material transport and PV panel production52 and disturbance to
bird/bats flyways due to the operation of the solar plant.
133. For the purposes of establishing the environmental baseline and assessing the
potential environmental impacts, the area of influence for impacts on 60-MW solar plant
ecology is taken as 3 km radius. Particular attention was paid to identify:
§ Sensitive natural environmental receptors such as water bodies, biodiversity and
wildlife habitats;
§ Sensitive human receptors such as households, schools;
§ Cultural and heritage sites (such as temples and animism sites); and
§ Potential health and safety issues.
134. According to IFC-PS1 2012 -, the area of influence encompasses:
§ (i) The project53 and the client's activities and facilities that are directly owned,
operated or managed (including by contractors) and that are a component of the
project;54
§ (ii) impacts from unplanned but predictable developments caused by the project that
may occur later or at a different location; and
§ (iii) indirect project impacts on biodiversity or on ecosystem services upon which
Affected Communities' livelihoods are dependent.
135. Cumulative impacts55 that result from the incremental impact, on areas and resources
used or directly impacted by the project, from other existing, planned or reasonably defined
developments at the time the risks and impacts identification process is conducted. GS6 is an
existing facility of the sovereign NSP project and is only indirectly related to PRAC's 60MW
solar plant.
4.4 Baseline Receptor Summary
136. The following section of the ESIA provides the description of the baseline environment
for the project components for PRAC's 60MW solar plant Key receptors information was
obtained and collated based on-site visits, stakeholder consultations, socio-economic survey,
biodiversity assessment, discussions and interviews with local authorities during this ESIA
prepration. A summary table for key receptors is provided in Table 12 while Figure 5 & 6
presents the project location with receptor information.
52 PV panel production is energy intensive and causes depletion of some natural resources, because bulk semiconductor
material is needed in high quantities (Tsoutsos et al. 2005).
53 Examples include the project's sites, the immediate airshed and watershed, or transport corridors.
54 Examples include power transmission corridors, pipelines, canals, tunnels, relocation and access roads, borrow and
disposal areas, construction camps, and contaminated land (e.g. soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediments).
55 Cumulative impacts are limited to those impacts generally recognized as important on the basis of scientific concerns
and/or concerns from Affected Communities. Examples of cumulative impacts include: incremental contribution of
gaseous emissions to an airshed; reduction of water flows in a watershed due to multiple withdrawals; increases in
sediment loads to a watershed; interference with migratory routes or wildlife movement; or more traffic congestion and
accidents due to increases in vehicular traffic on community roadways.

4.5 Physical Resources
4.5.1 Topography
137. The objectives of the study are to:
§ Collect data on elevation of the project site where there are low/high elevation
and slopes
§ Collect current positions including coordinates of all important topographical
featuresin and around the project site
§ Study the catchment area of the project site
138. Methodology – The ESIA assessment team used ASTER GDEM data available at the
Ministry of Economics, Commerce, and Industry, Japan, and at NASA, USA, in 2011. Moreover,
the assessment team utilizes ArcMap10 to investigate slopes with the ASTER GDEM data
gathered within a 1-kilometer radius around the proposed facilities.
139. The topography of the project site consists of gentle hills. To the south of the site
topographic relief decreases as the border with Kampong Speu province is approached. The
project area itself is dominated by gently undulating terrain at elevations ranging from 80 m
to 200 m above sea level, with some isolate d scattered hills rising to around 400 m. The area
is dissected by numerous ephemeral drainages that flow into the perennial An Long Chrey
Reservoir. There are no large lakes or major rivers in and around the project site. Residents
generally establish settlements near streams or irrigation channels and along the existing
access road running through the Royas and Chhoun Chet villages in Chhean Loeung commune.
140. The Project area is covered with degraded scrubland due to heavy agricultural
practices and clearing associated with local settlements. The area is mostly covered by the
grass and small shrubs.
4.5.2 Soil quality
141. Methodology: The ESIA team collected soil data i.e. types, quality, and uses for
different purposes in and around the project site. The project activities will not pose significant
risks to soil quality and uses, the assessment team depends very much on existing data and
documents and collected one soil sample (X=433651, Y=1303521) (Figure 10) for laboratory
testing. Soil quality parameters are listed in the table below. The following soil parameters
were referred to the suggested list by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery, and Forestry (MAFF)
(Table 13) for any soil quality study in Cambodia. A quick soil survey of the anticipated project
footprint is conducted to characterize soil types within the project area to understand how
eroded it is based on the current state (i.e. erosion potential, storm water run-off quality and
rehabilitation efforts) and land use practices.
142. To collect the soil sample, a soil auger was used to drill deep straight into the ground,
up to 50cm to get the best estimate of soil nutrient levels. Multiple soil cores were taken to
reduce the chance of pulling one from a 'bad spot'. The collected cores were kept in a clean

143. Soils in Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu provinces are typically clayey and
physically inferior, with relatively low soil fertility. Coarse grained granite rocks of Oral
Mountain located in the west of Kampong Chhnang province and some hilly outcrops in the
province. Despite the poor soil quality, arable farming is common. The predominant soil types
in the project site are Grey hydromorphics (82 ha) and red-yellow podzols (18 ha) (Figure 7).
144. The results show that all parameters are below MAFF's soil fertility guideline levels for
healthy soil. Nutrient levels are relatively high indicating good fertility. Total nitrogen in the
project site is only 0.22% that is in the medium range if compared with the soil fertility level.
There is a very high organic matter (4.35%) in the project site. But the test result shows that
total phosphorus has only 0.02% in the project site which is low. From an environmental
health perspective, it can be concluded that soil quality within and around the project is in
relatively good condition and not significantly degraded. A detail of each soil parameters is
described below the table.

§ Moisture is the level of moisture in between the soil particles that is essential for the
growth of the plants. Moisture plays a role of accelerating the decomposition process
of organic matters in the soil, i.e. it keeps soil fertile and increases in the growth of crops.
The laboratory result indicates that soil moisture in the project site is in range of 1.26%
to 1.82% that is known to be low.
§ Based on the standard of Directorate of Agriculture Department (2015), total carbon has
five levels in soil – 1. very high (>2.0%), 2. high (1.7%-2.0%), 3. medium (0.8%-1.7%), 4.
low (0.4%-0.7%), 5. very low (<0.4%). The test result shows that total carbon in the
project site has 2.53% that is very high.
§ Total nitrogen is important for agricultural crops especially supporting the growth of the
crops. The laboratory result shows that total nitrogen in the project site is only 0.22%
that is in the medium range if compared with the soil fertility level determined by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry (MAFF).
§ CN (C/N Ratio) is a factor of soil decomposition that determined the ways and levels of
decomposing the organic matter in soil by the bacteria. The result indicates that the
project site has such ratio of 12 meaning that there is a good decomposition for
agricultural crops (based on MAFF's soil fertility is from 8.0-13).
§ Organic matter helps us understand the nutrient and organic levels of each soil layers in
supporting the growth of the crops. The laboratory test result shows that there is a very
high organic matter (4.35%) in the project site.
§ Total phosphorus (P205) is a nutrient needed by the organisms for their living process.
Such nutrient is found in rocks, soil, and organic matter. Total phosphorus is essential for
planting crops and consists in every cell of lives including plant and animal. Phosphorus
attaches strongly to soil particles and is used by the plants. The test result shows that
total phosphorus has only 0.02% in the project site which is low.
§ Available phosphorus Bray II in the project site has 24ppm. This result indicates that this
phosphorus in the soil is in the medium level.
§ Cation exchange capacity is used to measure the soil fertility, to determine the nutrient
maintenance, and to prevent groundwater from being contaminated by other pollutants.
The result shows that the cation exchange capacity is 14.50 me/100g soil – meaning that
it is the medium capacity.
§ The cation exchange has key components such as Ca, Mg, Na, and K. This group has a
high capacity to absorb the soil nutrient and helps accelerate the growth of plan and
crop. The result indicates that soil in the project site has 7.60 me/100g of Calcium (Ca),
that is low; 2.20 me/100g of Magnesium (Mg) is found to be medium; and 2.89 me/100g
of Sodium (Na) is known to be low; and 0.64 me/100g of Potasium (K) is medium.
§ The total exchangeable bases refer to the sum of other components such as calcium,
magnesium, sodium, and potasium. Based on the test result, this exchangeable base is
only 13.33 me/100g soil – indicating that the total exchangeable base is low.
§ The bass saturation has a relation with the cation exchange capacity (Ca, Mg, Na, K). If
bass saturation is high, it means that the acidity level in soil is more neutralized for a
short time, than the soil with low saturation. The result shows that the bass saturation
is 92% which indicates the very high saturation.
§ The exchange AL is an important factor affecting the productivity of the agricultural crop
in the tropical climate. This exchange AL is related with the soil fertility and if it is high,
then it means that soil quality is low. The test result shows this AL has only 0.22 me/100g
soil that means it is low. Moreover, the electrode conductivity result is only 191 which
is very low.
§ The pH H20 is essential to measure the potentiality of nutrient and polluted components
for the plants. Plants grow well when the pH is between 5.7 and 7. The result shows that
pH is 9.02 which it is more alkaline. While the pH KCL in the soil in the project site is 8.12
– indicating that there is a high acidity.

4.5.3 Climate
145. The objectives of the climate and meteorology baseline studies are to:
§ Identify and describe meteorological data sources relevant to the project;
§ Characterize the existing and historical meteorological conditions in the project
region; and
§ Characterize the meteorological conditions of the project area.
146. Methodology – Baseline climate and meteorological conditions of the Project area are
determined and climatic variability is assessed based on available on site data and long-term
records from regional sites. This includes the assessment of:
§ Rainfall, including assessment of extreme rainfall events;
§ Temperature;
§ Evaporation; and
§ Humidity.
147. Cambodia is situated in a tropical zone between 10 and 14 degrees latitude north of
the equator. The climate is dominated by the monsoon cycle with a distinct dry season and
wet season. The northeast monsoon brings in the dry season from November to April. The dry
season is cooler from November to January when cool air from Siberia flows in and is dry and
hot from February to April. The wet season is from May to October, as southwest monsoon
brings in moisture and rains from the Indian Ocean. Most provinces experience an average
wind speed of less than 3 m/s. The maximum wind speed in the rainy season is over 20 m/s
while it is lower during the dry season.
(A) Temperature
148. Data recorded by the meteorological station in Kampong Chhnang province indicates
mean monthly maximum temperatures of 32.7–39.2°C, with a minimum in December and
maximum in April. The annual average temperature from 2016-2018 is only 35.2°C, in which
2017 has the lowest average. At the same time, the mean monthly average minimum
temperature is from 17.9-22.4°C, where the lowest is in December and highest is in March.
21°C is the annual average temperature among the three years, and 2018 has the lowest
annual average (19°C).

5.4.4 Air quality
150. The objectives of the air quality assessment are to:
§ Review the available baseline air quality monitoring data, and collect any further
data required to ensure that there is a sufficient baseline for the project area;
§ Identify appropriate noise, vibration and air quality assessment criteria, where
available;
§ Characterise the existing air quality and noise/vibration in the project area
§ Estimate the potential sources for vibration, air and noise emissions from the
project, and identify any potential impacts on sensitive receptors
§ Identify suitable management and mitigation measures that will minimise any
direct adverse effects from vibration, noise and air emissions associated with the
Project.
151. Methodology
§ An air quality baseline is established for the project area through the field sampling
with MoE laboratory team in September 2020. Prior to this, available air quality
monitoring data was reviewed.
§ The potential impacts of air emissions from the project were assessed, and
management measures to prevent or minimize any identified impact are
recommended. The primary air quality issue requiring assessment is likely to be the
generation of dust from transportation mostly. Additionally, greenhouse gas
emissions, for example those associated with energy usage, were considered during
the assessment.
§ The assessment of potential air quality impacts was undertaken by analysing the
exploration plan and using relevant emission factors to estimate the quantity of
total suspended particulate matter (TSP), sub-2.5 and sub-10 micron particles
(PM10, PM2.5) that would be emitted from each operation. In addition, more
parameters were analysed namely NO2, SO2, CO, Pb, and O3 as listed below. The
site meteorological data relevant to air quality issues was reviewed – in particular,
rainfall and temperature.
§ The current study collected two samples– (1) within the project site ANV01

(X=434264, Y=1303047) and (2) near the existing access road ANV02 (X=439465,
Y=1303928) (Figure 10).
§ Potential impacts of all significant air emissions from the project are assessed with
respect to the relevant Cambodian standards (MoE's Declaration in 2018), and
appropriate management measures to prevent or minimize identified impacts were
recommended. This includes a framework for ongoing monitoring, including
recommendations for monitoring locations and frequency.
§ The assessment and management of potential dust impacts were based upon the
following criteria: (a) Declaration on Uses of Terms of Reference for Establishing
Factory and Handicraft (2018), and (b) IFC EH&S Guidelines (2007)

Sampling activities in Location 1 (within the project site)
Sampling activities in Location 2 (near the existing access road)
152. Field visits indicated that air quality in the project site was good as the project areas
are located in rural areas without significant industrial/commercial zones to cause air quality
degradation or high noise levels. Typically, in Cambodia, outside Phnom Penh or town centers
there are few industrial pollution sources and the volume of vehicular traffic is low. There was
no available air quality data or noise level measurement for the project provinces. Air quality
and noise monitoring were taken to inform the environmental baseline in this ESIA for this
solar plant.
153. The baseline for air quality within and around the project site is carefully studied to
capture the current situation and how it is already influenced by the surrounding projects.
The study collects the field air parameters in two different locations as indicated above (Figure
10) based on the selected parameters (i.e. TSP, O3, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO and Lead) as
agreed in the terms of reference. Test was conducted for 24 hours on site, starting from 10am
till 10am in the next day. Assessment of the baseline air quality is based on Cambodian quality
standards and the result is listed in the Table 18 below.

154. The IFC ambient air quality guideline in 2007 (based on WHO Air Quality Guideline in
2005) does not regulate the standard for CO, TSP and Pb, but covers the rest. Unlike the
Ministry of Environment, the eight critical parameters are determined as illustrated in the
above table. Values of the parameters in the second location (near the existing access road)
seem a little bit higher than those in the project site. This is because of more traffic and
commuting activities of the local people on and around the road. However, the results from
the two sampling sites are below the MoE's standards. When compared with the IFC, also they
are all under the determined threshold values, except the SO2 which is slightly above the limit
due to the frequent traffic specially in testing location 2 (near the main road).
4.5.5 Noise
155. Methodology
§ Available noise monitoring data was reviewed. Further fieldwork was required to
ensure that a sufficient baseline for noise levels is available.
§ Potential noise sources and sensitive receptors (e.g. local villages) were identified.
The project construction and operation plans are analysed to determine the
locations of equipment including trucks, bulldozers, drills and other fixed and
mobile equipment required for construction works.
§ The study collected two samples to build the baseline of noise for the project.
Locations selected are (1) within the project site ANV01 (X=434264, Y=1303047)
and (2) near the existing access road ANV02 (X=439465, Y=1303928) (Figure 10
below).
§ The potential impacts of noise generating activities on sensitive receptors such as
local villages were assessed based on Cambodian and international standards that
are referenced where appropriate. Potential noise impacts on sensitive receptors
located along the likely transportation and access routes are assessed.
§ Management and mitigation measures were developed that helps minimise any
direct adverse effects associated with noise from the project. This includes a
framework for ongoing noise monitoring, including recommendations for

§ The assessment and management of potential noise impacts were based upon the

Handicraft (2018), and (b) IFC EH&S Guidelines (2007)

156. Table 20 below lists the result of the observed noise level for 24 hours in two locations
– (1) within the project site, and (2) near the existing access road (Figure 10). Hourly LAeg
noise at the two sampling sites was found to be below the standard of Cambodia standard.
Result from location 2 (near the access road) recorded the slightly higher value than the
location 1 and this is due to high mobility of the local villagers. Noise is observed to increase
from 11:00-12:00 am and 19:00-20:00 at night. The average 24-hour noise level of location 1
is recorded at 47.20 dBA and 54.84 dBA is for location 2. When compared with the IFC's
residential standard for both day and night times, the results from the two locations can be
inferred a little bit higher the guideline values in the day-time but critically sensitive at night
from 22:00 to 6:00 in the morning. The frequent transportation of the products from factory
(Mountain Rock Manufacturing) which is about 3-4km away from project site and access road
is doubtful to be causing such disturbing noise.

4.5.6 Vibration
157. Methodology
§ Available vibration monitoring data was reviewed. Further fieldwork was required
to ensure that a sufficient baseline for vibration levels is available.
§ Potential vibration sources and sensitive receptors (e.g. local villages) were
identified. The project construction and operation plans are analysed to determine
the locations of equipment including trucks, bulldozers, drills and other fixed and
mobile equipment required for construction works.
§ The study collected two samples to build the baseline of vibration for the project.
Locations selected are (1) within the project site ANV01 (X=434264, Y=1303047)
and (2) near the existing access road ANV02 (X=439465, Y=1303928) (Figure 10).
§ The potential impacts of vibration generating activities on sensitive receptors such
as local villages were assessed based on Cambodian and international standards
that are referenced where appropriate. Potential vibration impacts on sensitive
receptors located along the likely transportation and access routes are assessed.
§ Management and mitigation measures were developed that helps minimise any
direct adverse effects associated with vibration from the project. This includes a
framework for ongoing vibration monitoring, including recommendations for
monitoring locations and frequency.
§ The assessment and management of potential virbation impacts were based upon
the Declaration on Uses of Terms of Reference for Establishing Factory and
Handicraft (2018). There is no specific standard for IFC EH&S Guidelines on vibration.

158. Ground vibration was measured at the two locations – (1) in the project site, and (2)
near the existing access road for 10 minutes every 1-3 hours. The vibration results are similar
with the results of the noise level in a way that they are all below the MoE's standard across
the 24 hours, and the location 2 has higher values than those in location 1. Same reason for
such bigger values is due to the more frequent travels of trucks transporting factory products
to Phnom Penh. The average 24-hour vibration level is 19.06 dB for location 1 and 23.16 dB
for location 2, which these values are far below the standards – 65 dB for day and 60 dB for
night.

4.5.7 Surface and groundwater quality
(A) Surface Water Quality
159. There are two important Ou (streams) in the project site that drains into the An Long
Chrey Reservoir. These waterways run through and are close to the project site (Figure 12).
These two streams run at full capacity during the rainy season when water usually floods their
edges, banks and other riparian plants and trees, but less in dry season. These two streams
are essential habitats for aquatic biodiversity. Any physical change, flow and water quality may
pose critical concerns over their resources.
160. The objectives of the water quality are to:
§ Characterize the current baseline surface water quality of major streams
within/near the project area, upstream and downstream of the project
§ Characterize the current baseline hydrology of major streams within / near the
project area, upstream and downstream of the project
§ Compare the baseline water quality data to relevant national and international
standards

§ Assess potential impacts on water quality, and hydrology associated with the
project during the project phases
§ Identify suitable management measures for minimizing potential impacts on
water quality, and hydrology associated with the project
161. Methodology – Baseline water quality data were collected in the project area on 22
September 2020. Water quality data was compared to appropriate national and international
water quality guidelines, such as those listed below. Cambodian water quality standards were
used for comparison with baseline surface quality data, wherever possible. When Cambodian
standards did not exist for certain parameters, relevant international standards were used.
162. For surface water sampling, the study documented the current condition of water
quality in one stream by testing water sample from 2 locations (Figure 10) – (1) in Preak Mkak
closed to the project boundary [SW01 (X= 433561, Y=1303122)] and (2) in the small canal
within the project boundary [SW02 (X=434129, Y=1303449)]. Parameters for water testing are
described below.
Cambodian water quality legislation and standards
§ Sub-decree on Water Pollution Control (1999)
§ Law on Water Resources Management in Cambodia (2007)
§ Drinking Water Quality Standards (2004)
International water quality standards
§ World Bank/IFC Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines (2007); and
§ WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality, fourth edition (2011)
163. The general procedure for surface water sampling was as follows:
§ Bottles were labelled with site ID and date
§ Gloves were used to prevent sample contamination
§ Bottles (500 mL) were filled with sample water without headspace
§ Bottles were sealed carefully
§ Bottles samples were chilled
164. Surface Water. The proposed 60 MW solar plant is located upstream of a reservoir that
serves a 170 kW micro-hydro An Long Chrey project. The reservoir gathers the interflow from
three main streams57 (source - upper catchment Aural) with major inflow from Stung Chreav
stream. Two of these streams transect the project site while Stung Chreav stream bypasses
the proposed project site by a distance of 1.6 km (Figure 12). These two streams are the only
surface water bodies within the proposed solar plant site and will be conserved in its current
natural condition.58 Preliminary findings from the hydrological study suggests that the An Long
Chrey reservoir experiences overflow during operation on recurring basis; in February 2012
the overflow extended up to 1.5 km from the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site. The
reservoir is located approximately 4 to 5 km from the site, therefore overflow will not be an
issue. As seen in the area, there are no protected surface water bodies within the project area

quality test results show that parameters of the water quality are all under the allowable
standards permitted by the Ministry of Environment (see Table 23 below) for public water
protection. DO is very good in both locations which mean that the water supports the
ecosystems very well. Heavy metal in water is relatively low; for instance, Hg, As, Fe are very
less presented in water – posing no serious concern for domestic uses, except for drinking.
Similarly, the Total Coliform is high for both locations, which alert the public health issue. Oil
and grease is high in location two due to there are some clearing activities from the nearby
farms. In general, the water quality at the two sampled locations is relatively good with
respect to ecosystem health, but is not suitable for drinking.

(B) Groundwater Quality
166. For groundwater sampling, one sample was collected in a village closed to the project
site since there is no borehole located within the 60MW solar plant site. This well located 2
kilometers, north of the project plant and has been used for one year for mainly domestic use
i.e. washing and cleaning. The depth of the well where sample is collected is around 40 meters.
The sampling location is GW (X=433492, Y=1306328) (Figure 10). Selected parameters for the
groundwater are listed in the table below.
167. Sample collection and analysis methodology: Sample was collected during rainy
season. Field parameters are monitored using multi-parameter water quality probes. Sample
was also collected in bottles containing the appropriate preservatives for analysis at an
accredited analytical laboratory (i.e. MoE's laboratory). Consistent with Cambodian and
internationally recognized guidelines, the following laboratory parameters for groundwater
are sampled. The depth to groundwater varies from location to location. The depth is in
between 40-60 meters as the areas closed to solar plant is relatively high with average
elevitation from 80-200 meters above sea level rise (see section 4.5.1). The groundwater is
mainly used for agriculture, grazing, and domestic use, but not for drinking. People use

little bit dry during the dry season.
168. The groundwater quality is tested and the result shows that parameters of water
quality are well below the human drinking thresholds determined by the Ministry of
Environment. Heavy metals are below the allowable permit for domestic uses, but it is not
recommended for any intake. Iron and Al were slightly above the permittable standard. Hg
and C6H6 could not be detected during the analysis which means that there is no or very less
Hg and C6H6 in the groundwater.

169. Water Usage and Sources. Information on water usage and source by households in
the project-affected communes are included under the Socio-Economic Profile of this section.
Public consultations confirmed that the water usage is mainly for household use, feeding
animals and irrigation. Water is sourced from local ponds, streams, and river or groundwater
wells.
59 The testing faciltities cannot detect it, and it means there is less Hg or absence of Hg in the water.

5.4.8 Hydrology
170. The objectives of the hydrology study are to:
§ Characterize the current baseline hydrology within/near the project area,
upstream and downstream of the project
§ Assess potential impacts on hydrology associated with the project during the
project phases
§ Identify suitable management measures for minimizing potential impacts on
hydrology associated with the project
171. Methodology – A field visit to document the hydrology baseline in the project area was
conducted on 22 September 2020. Existing baseline hydrology was reviewed and additional
data was collected throughout the ESIA process to ensure that an extensive pre-project
baseline was available.
172. An hydrological study assesses the entire catchment area of the selected site for the
60 MW solar plant and immediately associated areas. Assessment takes account of peak
rainfall season (September 2020) and anticipated increases in frequent and/or intense
extreme weather events. Preliminary assessment shows the proposed project site is outside
the flood boundary. Figure 11 presents the site contour generated by Google Earth and ArcGIS
while Figure 12 shows stream inflow at the proposed project site.
173. In the closed vicinity of the project site, there is a big irrigation reservoir known as An
Long Chrey, developed by the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, under the Krang
Ponley Water Resources Development Project from November 2009 to February 2012 with
the financial support from Republic of Korea. This reservoir locates 48 km from Kampong Speu
province. There are three main streams discharging water into this reservoir, namely Stueng
Krang Ponley, Stueng Chreav, and Preak Mkak. This reservoir has a total catchment area of
479km2, and with 6.2km length. The normal height of the water is 69.5m and there are 10
associated structures. The reservoir can generate 170kW of electricity. This reservoir is
beneficial for agriculture, fishing and domestic consumption. Moreover, there are other six
associated canals diverting water to other users.

4.5.8 Natural Hazards
174. Climate Risks. The the 60 MW solar plant has been screened for climate risks using the
AWARE climate risk-screening tool60 as part of the NSP and the overall risk level is Medium.
The screening noted that the proposed project site is located in a region that may be
potentially at a High-Level Risk from recurring major flood events and precipitation induced
landslides and as such mitigation measures in the design are required. The screening also
noted that the proposed project site is at a Medium Level Risk for increase in temperature and
precipitation, change in water availability and solar radiation. Following the screening results,
a Climate Risks and Vulnerability Analysis (CRVA) has been undertaken for the NSP. Project
components sensitive to climate change were identified as listed in Table 25 below. These
potential impacts are managed through design mitigation measures, where appropriate in
accordance with the Guidelines for Climate Proofing Investments in the Energy Sector.

and other infrastructure
§ Increased losses within the
substation and transformers
§ Increased risk of corrosion of steel
infrastructure (lattice towers) with a
corresponding increase in humidity
§ Increased risk of drought episodes
and dust damage to solar PV plants
60The screening is based on the AwareTM geographic data set, compiled from the latest scientific information on current
geological, climate and related hazards together with projected changes for the future where available. These data are
combined with the project’s sensitivities to hazard variables, returning information on the current and potential future
risks that could influence its design and planning.

175. Extreme Weather Events. Storms and typhoons are not considered a major problem in
Cambodia as surrounding mountain ranges protect the country. However, some storms do
occasionally affect the country with most storm-related damage caused by localized floods
associated with heavy rain. Tropical storms can also affect the level of Mekong River flooding
and cause flash floods62 as well as increase the risk of precipitation-induced landslides.
176. Some parts of Kampong Chhnang province were affected by flash floods in the recent
past. The maximum flood extent in 200063 by the Mekong River flood and the maximum flash
flood extent in 2011 and 2013 are presented in Figure 13. As seen in the figure, the proposed
project site was out of the flood boundary during these events. The project area communes
report heavy precipitation and corresponding floods that affected large areas of rice paddy
fields in 2015. Kampong Chhnang province was affected by drought in January 2002
considered as the worst in two decades by the National Committee of Disaster Management
and lasted until the onset of rains in mid-August. The project area communes report droughts
as recurring phenomena during the dry season.
177. The project region is at low risk for geological hazards such as earthquake, seismic
landslide, volcano and tsunami as well as potential decrease in incidences of precipitation.
Therefore, these were not further elaborated for the purpose of discussion.
62 The Mekong river floods are a result of the cumulative rainfall in the upper catchment of the Mekong throughout the rainy
season. Mekong river floods are common in the provinces of Stung Treng, Kratie, Kampong Cham, Prey Veng, SvayRieng,
Kandal, and Takeo. Flash floods are a result of repeated heavy rainfall in mountainous areas that flow to streams and
tributaries of the Mekong River. Flash floods are swift, last only a few days but often cause severe damage to crops and
infrastructure especially in tributaries around the Tonle Sap Lake.
63 The year 2000 is considered as the worst flood in the recent history of Cambodia

4.5.9 Protected Areas
178. Of all Protected Areas in Cambodia, the closest is the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary
located within 20 km from the proposed project site in Aural district of Kampong Speu
province. The sanctuary was designated as a National Protected Area (NPA) as per the Royal
Decree on Protected Area, 1993. The NPA covers an area of 253,750 ha and contains a variety
of landforms, elevations and geology and is considered as an important bird and biodiversity
area. Tonle Sap Lake, a Protected Area is located northwest of the proposed project site at a
distance of about 60 – 65 km. The Protected Area is not within the project area of influence
and will not be impacted by the project. The biodiversity assessment conducted for this
project documents the migratory birds flying over the project site to these protected areas.
The Phnom Aural National Protected Area and the proposed project site are shown in Figure

4.6 Ecological Resources
4.6.1 Flora/plant survey
179. This was to record the existing species presented in the plant site to alert the
construction and management plans of the project in order to avoid disruption or design
better response to keep them as much as possible. Since there was no commercial and large
plants onsite, the survey was to record the report of the local people who used to get in
around the plant site and knowledged the local species. Primary methods were:
§ Interview with relevant local people and relevant technical departments in the
Kampong Chhnang province
§ Certain locations on the water body were visited if necessary to review potential
habitats (i.e. An Long Chrey Reservoir). For forest, site review was needed since
there was no recent forest cover available.
180. Quick forest survey and resource uses – The objectives of the forest survey and forest
resource use studies are to:
§ Describe the status of flora in the project area and identify any high value habitat
or rare and endangered species
§ Describe any local community use of flora collected in the project area
§ Record locations and conservation values of nearby protected areas
§ Assess the potential impacts of the project on forest resources in the vicinity of the
project area
§ Develop avoidance, management and mitigation measures for the project,
including proposed measures to offset any unavoidable impacts from the project.
181. Scope of work and methodology – Given the location of the proposed project closed
to the Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and An Long Chrey Reservoir, the current status of terrestrial
flora in the area and potential impacts needed to be rapidly assessed. Important habitats and
the presence of any species of conservation significance were determined. Furthermore, the
importance of vegetation resources for subsistence and livelihood uses were also assessed.
Indigenous knowledge survey was used as well as field surveys where required. The baseline
study presented available information in order to:
§ Describe key forest species, distribution, density, and their conservation
significance
§ Document the current forest status including their degradation and conservation
§ Describe the current uses of these forest resources
182. There are no protected areas or habitats of particular biodiversity value within the
project area of influence. The solar plant site is located in modified environment (disturbed
by human activity) dominated by scrubland with scattered trees and paddy fields, however it
contains two natural streams that transect across the site and these are important for
conservation since these serve the local habitat (also refer to discussion in Physical Resources
above).
183. The survey of flora was conducted through visiting the site and interviewing local
villagers about the presence of existing species records 26 plants and small trees. Shorea
Obtusa (Shorea tumbuggaia) is found and rated by IUCN as Nearly Threatened, but the trees
are small in diameters which have no economic values. The existing habitats have been
severely modified due to agricultural practices including public grazing. The found species are
small plants Siam Tulip (Curcuma alismatifola) is very common on the ground in the project
site, but this plant is categorized as nearly threatened. The rest cannot be identified in the Red
List, but seems to be least concerned.

184. Community forests. The Tbeng Srorng (or Andong Breng) protected community forest
(located approximately 5-7 km away on the southeast from the proposed solar plant site)
covers an area of 254,56 ha and has a mix of diverse tree species that are grown and/or
regenerated. The habitats located within this community forest can be considered as new
regenerating natural habitat and a good ecosystem for wildlife. This community forest will not
be affected by this project.

4.6.2 Fauna survey and resource uses
185. The objectives of the wildlife survey and resource use studies are to:
§ Describe the status of fauna in the project area and identify any high value habitat
or rare and endangered species
§ Describe any local community use of wildlife collected in the project area
§ Assess the potential impacts of the project on wildlife biodiversity in the vicinity of
the project area
§ Develop avoidance, management and mitigation measures for the project,
including proposed measures to offset any unavoidable impacts from the project.
186. Scope of work and methodology – Given the location of the proposed project closed
to the Aural Wildlife Sanctuary and An Long Chrey Reservoir, the current status of terrestrial
fauna in the area and potential impacts is needed to be rapidly assessed. Important habitats
and the presence of any species of conservation significance were determined. Furthermore,
the importance of wildlife resources for subsistence and livelihood uses were also assessed.
Indigenous knowledge surveys were used as well as field surveys where required. The
baseline study presents available information in order to:
§ Describe key wildlife species, distribution, density, and their conservation
significance
§ Document the current wildlife status including their uses, threatening factors and
conservation
§ The survey is based on the guide Alan Rabinowiz (2000) and Carl Traeholt (2003).
187. Management measures for any impacts are developed, and suitable wildlife and
rehabilitation methods for the project area were identified as part of the ESIA process.
Proposed measures were also developed to offset any unavoidable impacts on biodiversity
from the project.
188. There were no endemic, rare, threatened or globally endangered species or species of
particular conservation value observed during the site visit or identified from consultations
and historic records at the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site. All bird species recorded or
tallied during the ground surveys that were conducted in dry season and wet season65 are
classified by IUCN as being of Least Concern category, these include regional migratory, local
migratory and ground birds.
189. An Long Chrey reservoir. The reservoir is located downstream of the the 60 MW solar
plant site at a distance of about 4-5 km. Based on its ecological condition coupled with
frequent increases in elevation of stored water especially during rainy season, this site can
attract some migrant bird species such as Lesser Whistling Duck, Cotton Pygmy Goose, Barn
Swallow, Asian Palm Swift, House Swift, etc as winter visitors (all IUCN Least Concern
classification). These birds migrate via the East Asian – Australasian Flyway.
190. 60MW Solar Plant Site. When considering the habitats within the proposed the 60 MW
solar plant and the wider surrounding area comprising of scrubland, agricultural farms,
streams as well as the downstream reservoir, these are modified habitats. At the 60 MW solar
plant itself, the presence of two natural streams may support bird species as well as wild pig,
muntjac, Burmese hare and other rabbit species (all Least Concern IUCN classification).
191. Comparison between Survey Results conducted during dry and wet season. Dry season
65 Dry season survey was conducted in March 2018 and covered the proposed solar park site and an alternative site. Wet
season survey was conducted in July 2018 and covered the proposed solar park site (close to the solar park site), An Long
Chrey Reservoir65 and Tbeng Srorng community forest (300 ha) located northeast of proposed solar park in Chean Leung
commune at a distance of approximately 4-5 km.
96

and wet season surveys for the NSP tallied and recorded a total of 78 and 24 bird species,
respectively at the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site. All bird species were of “Least
Concern” category as per IUCN. Only 16 bird species were common between dry and wet
season surveys. The difference in number of species recorded during the two surveys may be
attributed to seasonal migration. The dry season survey was conducted in March 2019, which
is a prime time for bird migration at global, regional and local level while the wet season survey
was conducted in July 2019, which is when most of the bird species move away to their
breeding or to other foraging grounds. The wet season survey indicates that that there is an
ecological connection between stream habitats, reservoir, dipterocarpaceae forest and
scrubland. The natural streams within the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site serve as the
feeding ground for Green Peafowl (Least Concern IUCN classification) while the
Dipterocarpaceae forest in Tbeng Srorng community forest serves as its breeding ground.
Other bird species may migrate to other nearby areas for feeding and breeding including the
Phnom Aural Wildlife NPA, the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve of the reservoir, for instance, the
migration of egret and heron species from the natural stream to the reservoir. In addition, the
habitat of Dipterocarpaceae forest and scrubland is also favorable for local migratory species
such as the eagle.
192. Community Forests. Tbeng Srorng community forest containing the Dipterocarpaceae
forest (300 ha) is suitable for wildlife such as Green Peafowl, Red jungle fowl, Wild pig, etc.
Most of red jungle fowl can breed within this habitat. This forest, located approximately 5-7
km northeast of the proposed the 60 MW solar plant site, will not be affected by the proposed
project. The local interviews in September 2020 at Royeas village in Chhaen Laeung commune
reported possible presence of endangered and vulnerable mammals and reptiles within Tbeng
Srong community forest as seen or heard within the last five years. Species included Dhole,
Fishing Cat (both classified as IUCN Endangered), Asiatic Jackal, and Burmese Python (both
classified as IUCN Vulnerable). However, these species and/or suitable habitats for these
species were not identified in the field survey (September 2020). The interviews also
confirmed that bird species found are typical of forested areas, wetlands and rural areas.
193. Mammals: 10 common mammal species were recorded during the field observation
and in-depth interviews with the local villagers living closed to the project site or having
wandered around in the project site. These are IUCN Least Concerned mammals and their
population has decreased remarkably in the last five years.

194. Bird species: 20 bird species were recorded during the interviews with local villagers
and field observation. Three IUCN nearly-threatened parakeet species were reported to be
present in the area, but their habitats could not be found. They were seen flying across the
area. The rest was classified as Least Concerned by IUCN and as common by Cambodian
Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry.

195. In addition, a bird survey assessment was commissioned66 for NSP in July 2019 and the
result confirmed that there were a total of 124 species identified including four Near-
Threatened Species (Blossom-headed Parakeet, Cambodian Tailorbird, Oriental Darter and
Red-breasted Parakeet) and one Endangered Species (Green Peafowl). The other 119 species
are classified as Least Concern. The development of the 60 MW solar plant will have minimal
impact on national populations of the near threatened Blossom-headed Parakeet and Red-
breasted Parakeet as their primary habitats are in Northern Cambodia, whilst Oriental Darter
is only a non-breeding visitor to the site.
196. A Baseline Bat Assessment for the NSP was conducted in October 2019 during the wet
season. The assessment confirmed the following results:
• Acoustic sampling yielded a total of 3,194 discrete bat passes, 92% of which were
66 Sam Veasna Center for Wildlife Conservation was commissioned to conduct the bird assessment during the
dry season under the sub-contractor no. 52096-001. Field surveys in and outside the command area were
conducted from 29 April 2018 to 10 May 2019. 24 Village interviews were conducted within these dates.

recorded in the Kampong Speu portion of the subproject area (SP-12 to SP-2367). Mean
nightly activity was 139 bat passes (SD ± 180), with a maximum of 539 passes at SP-13
and SP-21 and a minimum of 4 bat passes apiece at SP-6, SP-7, SP-10 and SP-11.
• Direct observations and interviews with residents did not reveal any significant
(e.g., >100 individuals) natural roosts for bats. No caves were detected and residents
consistently suggested that none occur in the vicinity of the subproject area. The same
was true of insectivorous bat farms and flying fox colonies, although occasional
sightings of flying foxes were reported at SP-4, SP-12, SP-19 and SP-20 which are
presumed to originate from outside of the subproject area.
• With the exception of Hipposideros cf. griffini (which has been proposed as Near-
Threatened), all bat species directly recorded during the survey are currently
recognised as Least Concern by the IUCN (2019). The sightings of flying foxes reported
by residents are presumed to represent Pteropus vampyrus (Near-Threatened) or P.
lylei (Vulnerable), because the only other flying fox in Cambodia (P. hypomelanus)
primarily occurs in coastal areas and on marine islands.
• Regarding its conservation significance, current data suggest that the subproject area
does not qualify for bats under criterion 1 (Habitat of Critically Endangered +/or
Endangered species), criterion 2 (Habitat of significant importance to endemic and/or
restricted-range species) or criterion 3 (Habitat supporting globally significant
concentrations of migratory species and/or congregatory species) of IFC Performance
Standard 6 (IFC 2012a,b)68&69.
Reptile species: Indochinese Spitting Cobra and King Cobra have been reported as present in
the area. They are IUCN vulnerable species. The area is good for small reptiles but not
critically-protected species.

198. 38 fish species were Anlong Chrey resevoir reported to be important for food for the
local people. Almost all of them could not be identified in the IUCN Red List and are commonly
known in Cambodia. There was IUCN Endangered species – Thickliped Barb - Probarbus
labeamajor reportedly present in the An Long Chrey reservoir. Since this reservoir is a
protected water body, the Prime Minister of Cambodia once releases hundreds of critical
species into this reservoir. As confirmed by the Kbal Toeuk commune chief and villagers during
the village consultation in September 2020, fishery resources in Preak Mkak are not
considered significant for fishing since there were little fish and no local fishermen catching
fish from this stream.

199. The objectives of the socio-economic assessment for the Project are to:
§ Establish a socio-economic baseline for the project region;
§ Identify possible social impacts of project activities on the communities in the
vicinity of the project area. These may include issues related to land loss, increased
migration, women, education, migration, health, economic status and employment;
and
§ Identify suitable avoidance, management and mitigation measures that help
minimise any adverse effects of the project on local villagers and help maximise
socio-economic benefits for the region.
200. Methodology – To establish a detailed socio-economic baseline for the project area,
socio-economic surveys cover possibly impacted villages, as well as key indirectly impacted
villages such as those along the transportation route, i.e. Royas and Chhoun Chet villages. The
survey was based on a standard best practice questionnaire that had been modified by the
survey team to reflect the specific socio-economic context of the project.

201. PRAC’s 60 MW Solar Plant is situated within the administrative area of Prey Chrov
Village in Kbal Toeuk Commune, where the population is located around 18km to the
northwest (from Solar Plant site to the commune where most people live around) and is
unlikely to experience any direct or indirect impacts from either the NSP or PRAC’s solar plant.
Therefore the study team focused on the population centers to the southeast that will
experience direct construction transport impacts and may benefit from employment
opportunities. Population on the main road (i.e. national road no. 52 or 136 from Odong to
Kampong Speu province) is far unlikely to be affected since the Project will not be using the
road for any project development purposes.
202. The study covered three communes – Kbal Toeuk commune in Toeuk Phos district,
and Chhean Loerng commune in Samaki Meanchey district, Kampong Chhnang province and
Prambei Mom commune in Kampong Speu province. Prambei Mom commune was selected
since the Project's transportation will be partly through the area of this commune. Only key
informant interviews with commune chiefs and village leaders were scheduled and conducted
in Chhean Loerng and Prambei Mom communes. Given the fact that the Project locates in
Kban Toeuk commune, but there are limited to no human receptors within 2km of the site,
the study team had gone beyond the 3km zone to find villagers to consult. The closest human
receptors that will be likely to be affected due to transportation are those living along the
existing access road (connected from national road no. 52). The study team decided to
randomly sample the 78-individual households for the socio-economic survey that was
conducted in Chhean Loerng commune where the local residents were living on exisitng
access road and also close to the Solar Plant (approximately 4-7 km) and are not linked to the
104
105
affected land since the land has been owned fom one person to another before being sold to
EDC70. Therefore, the socio-economic survey selected samples from Chhoun Chet and Royas
villages instead of Prey Chrov village. Based on the commune database, there are 236 families
and 515 people in Royas village and 80 families and 182 people in Chhoun Chet village. The
total household in Chhean Loeurng commune is 1,212. Sample size was determined based on
the current population data using the calculation formula of Yamane Taro (1967) as followed
with e=10% and 90% of confidence.
n = N/1+Ne2
(n=sample, N=total population, e=sampling error)
Thus, sample for Chhoun Chet village is 60 families and 18 families for Royas village.
203. Survey collects information required to:
§ Determine the age structure, sex ratio and any other relevant demographic
characteristics of the communities within the study area (i.e. mortality rates,
marriages, migration and ethnic composition)
§ Determine the number of residences, the range and average household size (area
and number of persons) within the study area
§ Describe the level of education and skill of people living in communities within the
study area
§ Determine the number of presently employed and unemployed people according
to gender from each of the villages in the following categories:
§ Education level
§ Skilled
§ Unskilled
§ Determine the average and range in household incomes and the proportion of
effort expended on subsistence versus cash economy activities within the study
area
§ Determine the principal sources of cash income for local people
§ Determine the use of and dependence on terrestrial and aquatic resources
§ Identify baseline public utilities and services available to local villages
§ Identify relevant safety and security issues and risks, such as those associated with
UXOs
204. Following completion of the baseline socio-economic study, the ESIA team then
assessed the potential socio-economic impacts and benefits of the proposed project.
Potential socio-economic issues were assessed including:
§ Impacts on socio-economic, cultural and livelihood activities in the region
§ Impacts on migration and future economic growth
§ Impacts on land use and land allocation
§ Impacts on community social frameworks and local political mechanisms
§ Impacts on poverty and development
§ Cumulative socio-economic impacts

(B) Socio-economic Profile
205. Demographics: The key informant interviews were conducted in Prambei Mom
commune, Thbong District, Kampong Speu province and in Kbal Toeuk Commune, Toek Phos
District, Kampong Chhnang province but only a 78-household survey was carried out in
Chhean Loerng commune in Royas and Chhoun Chet villages (Figure 16 above). The recent
population data (2019)71 shows that there are 2,745 families in Prambei Mom with a total of
11,992 people including 5,941 females. There are 329 female-headed families. For Kbal Toek,
there are 1,485 families with a total of 9,560 people including 3,177 females and 374 female-
headed families. For Chhean Loeurng commune, there are 1,212 families and 2,538 peoples.
The average household size across locations is 4-5 persons. There are no other ethnic groups
than Khmer in the selected samples and in the study areas.
206. Education: The survey concluded that 30% of the interviewed residents in the study
areas completed secondary school and only 5% went to university. Illiteracy is prevalent
among a certain age group due to schooling limitations during and immediately after the
Khmer Rouge period which resulted in 15% remained illiterate (Figure 23). Each Commune
has several primary schools and one lower secondary school while upper secondary schools
are located in only Khsem Khsant and Prambei Mom communes. There is one high school in
Prambei Mom – Hun Sen An Long Chrey. Also, three secondary schools exist in the areas –
Chrok Tnout Primary-Secondary School, Taing Por Primary School, Prambei Mom Primary
School, and Trapaing Troak Primary School. The 2017 Statistics72 from Ministry of Education,
Youth and Sports prove that Kampong Chhnang province has grown remarkably both in
education quality and quantity. The gross enrollment rate remains high up to 104.6%, 60.3%,
and 26.7% in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary level. There are 454 educational
entities (105 pre-schools, 273 primary schools, 60 lower secondary schools, and 16 upper
secondary schools) with a total student of 115,302 and 3,510 teachers.
207. Regarding vocational training, there is no specific data for each commune, but the
socio-economic data by the Ministry of Planning in 201673 recorded that there were 160,128
peoples with age from 18-35 in Kampong Chhnang province, and only 2,466 people have been
on vocational training. Record did not mention exactly what skills were trained and whether

in 1,000 people is really low in Toeuk Phos which is only 3.9. While 10.4 is recorded in Samaki
Meanchey district.

208. Occupation and income: During the field survey in both locations, there were diverse
economic activities that generated income for the local residents. Majority of the households
in the project area practice farming while some households run small businesses. Some
household members also earn their livelihood working in nearby factories/industries, at
construction sites and/or hold government staff positions. Livelihood generation and
employment on plantations was reported as temporary and seasonal. Agriculture is a main
occupation for both Royas and Chhoun Chet villages with large proportions of respondents
(55%) involved in farming and cropping. The rest combined as a secondary income generating
activities, including livestock, fishery, and worker in factories. Regarding the income, 15% of
the interviewed households earns less than 500,000 riel (US$125) annually; while the other
15% earns the most, more than 3,000,000 riel (US$750). Still poverty is a concern in the survey
area due to limited job opportunities. The poverty rate in Kampong Chhnang province in 2010
is only 30.4% and this percentage falls gradually till 2020. Based on the current survey in
September 2020, the current household poverty rate is around 28% among the interviewed
households which was reported by the commune chief. This rate is higher than the national
poverty line – 12.9% in 2020 74 in Cambodia. Moreover, there is no official record of what
occupations are for women or men in the study areas. Both males and females are involved
in similar occupations.

209. Energy. In terms of electricity, all interviewed persons reported that they could access
to electricity at households in the project area. This supply is provided by the Electricity du
Cambodia in Kampong Chhnang province. There is a grid connection around villages. In
addition, some households could access to private solar panel and batteries for additional
uses for lighting and household consumption.
210. For source of energy for cooking, firewood is the most common energy source for
cooking followed by electricity and liquid petroleum gas. Since the area is plenty of small
shrubs and re-generated small trees that were good to collecting the firewood. Gas is
commonly seen used for cooking in rural Cambodia in combination with firewood.
Figure 18: Energy Uses
211. Water use. There are varieties of water sources within the communes. More than half of the
interviewed persons collected rainwater for general household uses. It is observed that rainwater
harvesting materials are built up as an attachment to house structures. Water from stream and well
and open reservoir are of common uses after rainwater. The Figure below shows similar number of
access to these sources. Piped water is also accessible but with a small percentage if compared with
other sources. Local people use water in different ways. For drinking, rainwater and well are boiled
before drinking. For washing, cleaning, bathing, all sources are interchangeably used depending on
their seasonal availabilities. Regarding sanitation, conditions vary between households. Approximately
half the families have improved toilets (i.e. flush connected to sewerage or septic tank, or pit latrine
with slab).

212. Land use: The 60 MW solar plant requires 97 ha of land and the site is on a contiguous
piece of land in Kbal Toek upstream of the An Long Chrey Reservoir.75 There are no
habitations/settlements within the proposed site. This site was previously used for cassava
plantations and was later reportedly abandoned. The site assessment conducted for 197 ha
identified the site as mainly scrubland and paddy fields. The site is now a grass-field and a
grazing area for local villagers. This is a kind of opportunistic grazing by villagers since the land
is open and there is no fence to limit their access. There is no permission required to graze in
the area unless the cattle does not enter into any privately owned areas (usually it is fenced).
Around the Project, there are more open areas which can be used for grazing. There is some
farmland with sugar cane along the existing access road to the proposed site from Road No.
52. This existing road will be no use for the project once the new access road is finalized and
constructed by the EDC.
213. Health. The health facilities in the project area are limited. There is one health center
in Prambei Mom (i.e. An Long Chrey Health Center) and none in Kbal Toeuk. Local villagers
have to travel to Kampong Speu province, Kampong Chhnang province, or Phnom Penh for
serious illnesses. The official record by the Commune Database in 201676, malaria, dengue
and tuberculosis are presented in Kampong Chhnang province. The death ratio for dengue,
malaria, and tuberculosis, among 100,000 people, is 1.3, 1.3, 12.8 for Samakei Meanchey
District; and 0.0, 0.0, and 13.7 for Toek Phos District. In 2015, in person, there are only 8, 4,
and 40 people dying from dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis. There is no formal record of
other diseases but through the interviews with households in September 2020, hypertension,
diabetes, intestinal diseses are common among the respondents. Moreover, there are
132,780 women aging from 15-45 in Kampong Chhnang province and the ration of child birth
among 1,000 women is 66.1. Almost 100 per cent of these women deliver their babies with
the midwives. In 2015, there are 203 midwives in Kampong Chhnang province77.
214. Local traffic: The national road no. 136 is a main route leading from Odong district to
the project site. The traffic pressure on this road is medium since it connects from Odong,
Samaki Meanchey, Toeuk Phos, and Thbong districts to Kampong Speu province and vice-versa.
The road is in good condition and both light and heavy vehicles are commuting around. The

traffic survey considered the traffic pressure on the existing road that accesses to the project
site, and also impacts from project's transportation during the construction especially on the
settlements located along the route. Potential accidents or spills of materials were also
included. The primary result showed that the transportation need of the project was minimal
since the total planned construction was only 18 months and the needs of transporting
materials in and out of the project site were not a regular basis. The project would require
certain schedules to bring in materials and also not for a 24-hour routine. The number of
trucks used was limited to around 4-5 trucks per day to avoid the large volume that could
cause disturbance and accidents over the uses of route of the local villagers. The current traffic
flow was normal and light since there were no large industrial zones around the project site,
except the Marble Manufacturing Factory that shared the same existing road.

215. The survey showed that road in around the project site had one lane per side and there
were only two lanes per road. The suggested carrying-capacity of the road per lane was 2,000
PCU/h (passenger car units per hour per lane) with a minimum speed of 100km/h. Thus the
current carrying-capacity of the existing access road around the project site was 4,000 PCU/h.
According to Puopong (1997)78, the traffic low of the road could be described based on the
traffic ratios as below:
Table 33: Traffic Ratio
No. Traffic Ratio Traffic Flow
1 0.88-1.00 Very congested traffic
2 0.67-0.88 Congested traffic
3 0.52-067 Medium traffic
4 0.36-0.52 Light (good) traffic
5 0.20-0.36 Very light (very good) traffic
216. The traffic flow was determined through V/C Ration = Traffic Volume/Carrying Capacity
of Road. Then the survey result for 12 hours (7am-7pm) for the road diverting from national
road 136 to the project site showed that the traffic ratio was only 0.002 meaning that there
was a very good traffic in the area for both working days and weekend. For national road 136,
the traffic ratio recorded only 0.40 due to more vehicles present. Still the traffic flow remained
good, with no congestion in general.

CHAPTER 5: PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION
5.1 Consultation and Participation
219. Initial consultations79 with relevant stakeholders potentially affected by the National
Solar Park project were conducted by EDC‘s consultants in May and July 2018 to inform them
of the proposed project, potential temporary impacts and project benefits. During the
preparation of this ESIA report for 60MW solar plant, two public consultations at village level
were organized by a consultant team of Young Development Research and Consulting Co. Ltd
(YDRC) on 27 September 2020 to disseminate the 60MW solar plant information and discuss
the concerns and suggestions of the potentially affected peoples.
220. Appendix I of this ESIA includes:
§ The agenda for the public consultation meetings
§ The Guide Questionnaires for FGDs with women and with men
§ The 60MW solar plant's Project Information Booklet (PIB) in Khmer that distributed to
participants in the meetings
§ Photo documentation of the consultations
§ Attendance sheets with signatures
5.2 Consultations – 60MW Solar Plant
221. The second set of consultations covered participants (villagers) from a total of 3
villages in 2 communes (Figure 20) in the vicinity of the proposed the 60 MW solar plant
Kampong Chhnang province. Total of 26 persons (11 females) participated in the FGDs at the
village level. The first consultation was organized on 27 September 2020 in Royas village with
local residents from Royas and Chhoun Chet villages. The second village consultation was held
in Trapaing Troak village, Prambei Mom commune, Thbong district, Kampong Speu province,
where the future access road to be built by EDC is planned. The COVID-19 precautionary
measures were strictly applied with all participants during the consultation. Temperature-
checking, face masks, and hand-cleaning gel or alcohol spray were set up and required for
every participant prior to the discussion.
79 Consultations for the solar park were held as follows – 4 at village level. Out of 4 villages, only one village called Trapeang
Troak was covered twice for consultations (i.e. solar park).

222. Consultations with the affected persons includes information on the project
environmental impacts (positive and negative), safeguards measures including community
health and safety, training in emergency response, project implementation schedule and
process, results from environmental baseline surveys, and acquisition and compensation
process, affected households, affected persons’ right to complain and Project GRM.
Consultations with affected persons provides a two-way information sharing channel,
ensuring that the concerns, questions and ideas of the affected persons were discussed and
responded to in an appropriate and gender inclusive way.
(A) Village consultation in Royas Village, Chhean Loueng Commune, Samaki Meanchey
District, Kampong Chhnang Province
223. The consultative meeting started at 8:30am with the primary introduction of the team
and the project. The project size is 97 ha and locates in Kbal Toeuk village, Chhean Loueng
Commune, but the existing access route is from Tbong District, Kampong Speu province. The
project will be under the construction and operation of the PRAC that is granted the rights to
develop the project the period of 20 years in the scheme of BOO. The construction will take
up to 18 months and there will be solar plant, water ponds, guard post, and fence.
224. The predicted social and environmental impacts are listed in the table in the booklet
given to individual participants. The impacts range from soil erosion to social culture
disturbance. The significance of the impacts is averagely low in all project phases (pre-
construction, construction, operation). Mitigations to these impacts are given for some
examples to let participants clear with what will happen and how it will be managed.
116
117
225. The project is under the safeguard conditions of ADB and performance standards of
IFC and the environmental laws and regulations of Cambodia. Impact assessment is required
to enable the project to manage anticipated impacts. The presentation also highlighted the
PRAC's grievance mechanism that participants could exercise in case they were not happy with
the project's treatment or if they wanted to complain for any unprecedented impacts.
226. Participants were allowed to provide comments and feedback on the presentation.
Few people turned in with some concerns and suggestions.
• Participant 1: Since the project will use this road for the transportation, please drive
the vehicles safely, and avoid certain time (sleeping or school times) to not disturb the
people and their local economic activities.
• Participant 2: If the project needs some labor, please consider selecting us in the local
village so that we can get a job and some little income.
• Participant 3: The project must consult with villagers in advance if they place the
transmission poles and pay a proper compensation.
• Participant 4: The project has no big concern for us. We do not own any land there.
227. In response, YDRC confirmed that the impacts were associated with the project
activities of the solar plant only. Transmission line is a shared facility but not included in the
scope of impact assessment for the solar plant. There was a separate assessment already
undertaken for such facility.

228. The consultative meeting started at 3:30pm with the primary introduction of the
project. The project size is 97 ha and locates in Kbal Toeuk village, Chhean Loueng Commune,
but the existing access route is from Tbong District, Kampong Speu province. The project will
be under the construction and operation of the PRAC that is granted the rights to develop the
project the period of 20 years in the scheme of BOO. The construction will take up to 18
months and there will be 60 MW solar plant, access route, water ponds, guard post, and fence.
229. Participants were given the same project information as did in the consultation with
the villagers in Chhean Loerng commune.
230. Participants were allowed to provide comments and feedback on the presentation.
Few people turned in with some concerns and suggestions.
• Participant 1: We do not concern much about the project impacts since it is Toeuk Phos
district. What I concern is the placing the transmission poles to GS6. Just inform us and
pay us the compensation before the project starts.
• Participant 2: The access road is cutting through the private land and plantation. The
project must consult with the owners and address the land prices prior to building the
route.
• Participant 3: We are happy to see the project and expect of job employment for our
local villagers.
231. In response, the consultation confirmed that the impacts were associated with the
project activities of the solar plant only. Transimssion line is a shared facility but not included
in the scope of impact assessment for the solar plant. There is a separated assessment for
such facility. Participants were informed that prior to placing the transmission poles, EDC will
complete the compensation with informed consent from affected households. All concerns
and impacts will be addressed in the Resettlement Action Plan of EDC’s NSP. Similar treatment
will be conducted for the access road. Any associated impacts will be recorded and addressed
prior to any road construction. For employment, the project will require local labor to help
construct the project and this will give the opportunity to local villagers to be employed. The
sub-contractor will develop its own employment plan for PRAC.

(C) Consultative meeting with PramBei Mom Commune Chief, Thpong District, Kampong
Speu Province
• Because the project locates in Toeuk Phos district, there is no land conflict on the local
people in the commune, but I would like to request for appropriate resolutions if there
are conflicts occurred.
• I would also request for a proper caution in regard of traffic and public safety, especially
traffic accidents resulting from transporting materials and workers during the project
development phases.
• I suggest that prior to placing the transmission poles from the project, the project
owner must consult with local authorities and the affected villagers to avoid or
minimize land conflicts on private properties of the local villagers.
• I support the project.

232. In response, the consultant team informed that the PRAC built only the solar plant.
The assessment conducted this time was to capture concerns and suggestions of the relevant
peoples and stakeholders about the 60 MW solar plant – constructing and installing the PV
panel only.
(D) Consultative meeting with Chhean Loueng Commune Chief, Toeuk Phos District,
Kampong Chhnang Province
• Since the past this area belongs to private individuals and then they sold them to
Mother Barang (local nickname) who bought all land in the area for cassava plantation
and later the area is abandoned due to low productivity.
• The project site locates further away from the villages (Royas, Chhoun Chet) and the
areas are privately owned. As EDC already purchased the land from owners, then there
will be no serious land conflicts.
• I think the project activities will not cause any risks or damages on forest and wildlife
resources because there are less of such resources and it is the former farmland.
• I suggest the project owner (1) comply with regulations especially the regulations on
transporting materials and staff in and out of the site that would disturb or affect the
local villagers living along the road; and (2) cooperate with local authorities for every
activity.
(E) Consultative meeting with Mr. Soth Sang, Deputy-District Governor of Toeuk Phos (22
September 2020)
• The project owner must consult with local authorities and villagers in advance before
the start of the project work and must ensure that there will be no conflicts on the
right of way in front of their houses.
• The project owner must show the master plan and design of the project facilities and
locations so that people are aware of the project and are ready to cooperate in case
of there are conflicts or impacts from the project.
• I am very much happy with the development project because there is no sufficient
power in Cambodia yet.
• I request for a safe transportation of materials and staff in and out of the project site
that would cause traffic accidents unintentionally. Drivers must be trained and driving
must be monitored regularly to minimize the impacts.
• The project must not fill the cracks, canals, or streams within and closed to the project
site to avoid flood in the raining season. The project must prepare the drainage system
to avoid flood and drain the wastewater from the project site.
• I think this project has no severe concerns on the environmental and social resources
and the local villagers.
(F) Provincial consultation
YDRC organized a consultative meeting on 19 October 2020 with relevant departments in
Kampong Chhnang province. Mr. Khem Channorn, deputy-director of provincial
administration chaired the consultation since the deputy-governor was busy accompanying
the provincial governor for the flooding relief work. The consultation meeting followed the
120
121
agenda: (1) introduction to all participants, (2) remark by the chair, (3) project and ESIA
presentation, (4) questions and answers (including feedback), and (5) wrap up and closure.
There were 20 participants from provincial departments and local NGO (Build Community
Voice) (list of attendence is attached in the Appendix VI).
Mr. Khem Channorn – Deputy-Director
• It is a great pleasure to welcome the project since Kampong Chhnang province was
very attractive to many development projects.
• This is not the only one solar plant. In this province there are some others including
the one in Taing Krasaing commune.
• The solar plant is good to produce more energy and this energy is renewable. This
means that we can generate electricity for a long time since the sun never runs out of
its energy. This project can produce up to 60 MW and hope that this energy will help
reduce our power scarcity and reliance on fuel source.
• We meet to today to welcome the project and learn about it and provide our inputs or
comments to assure that the project minimizes the risks as predicted and brings more
benefits than losses to our communities and Cambodia as a whole.
• I would like to invite all of you to look through the presentation and materials provided
in this meeting and bring about the concerns and suggestions so that we develop the
project in a manner that is environmentally friendly and sound.
The consultant team of YDRC presents the project information and the ESIA findings to all
participants.
Mr. Van Rady, inter-sectoral officer of provincial office
• I fully support the project. I would request that if all land plots are not yet properly
purchased, please procedure with the buying-and-selling principles to assure it legality.
• I suggest having all plots combined into one-single tenure and registered with Land
Department in the province.
Mr. Saing Sokhern – Deputy-governor of Toeuk Phos district
• There is no route from Toeuk Phos to the project site. Thus the project has to go
through the national road no. 136 in Chhean Loeung commune. As far as I know, this
project closes to Kiri Aphivat village, which is a newly-established village in that area,
which borders with Toeuk Phos and Samaki Meanchey districts, and also closed to the
Tbeng Srorng community forestry. Most disturbed people are from this new village I
think. Therefore the project may need to build new road through Samaki Meanchey
district. My request is to help build such road in this district for not only the benefit of
the project, but also local people enjoy traveling around too. This road is about 4
kilometers.
• Because it is a government supported project, I totally support it.
Mr. Bong Bonny – Deputy-Director of Cults Department
• There is no impact on any sacred site as there is none of these in and around the
project site.
• I fully support the project.
Ms. Phin Phalla – Deputy-Director of Women Affairs Department
• Transportation of materials and staff or workers must lower the risks of dust and
minimizes the traffic accidents. Please water the road regularly to keep dust down
where dust is potentially generated.
• Local people are not using the road properly. Please ask your driver to be more
moderate and professional in driving i.e. with speed limits. Also the project shall
inform the local authority and people of the transportation schedule so that they could
manage themselves to avoid any road challenges.
Mr. Nou Sokhon – Deputy-Director of MLV Department
• What is the labor required for this project during the construction phase? How many
Cambodians and foreigners?
• I would suggest the project implement the safety measures for all workers and staff in
this project. Also please prepare the workbook of all staff and workers and inform the
MLV department prior to your groundwork.
Mr. Ouk Sophea – Deputy-Chief of Office of Transport and Public Work Department
• I support the project and the project is just aware of heavy transport to avoid road
pressure and damages.
• In case of heavy transport, please consult with the Department prior to any work.
Mr. Saing Sokhern – Deputy-Cheif of Toeuk Phos District
• I suggest the project inform us as local authority at least one week prior to any
groundwork so that I can arrange local guard and people to accompany to avoid any
unplanned conflicts.
• Also please keep the local authorities alerted and informed of any work of the project
Mr. Khem Channorn – Deputy-Director of Administration
• I would also request all participants here bring up your concerns and suggestions
based on your individual areas of work and expertises. Or you can mention if it is not
much relevant with you. Here is my summary of the meeting:
• (1) I support the suggestions from Agriculture Department, as to combine all land plots
into one and register with Land Department. Also please alert the local authorities
when the project starts working on the ground to avoid any unprecended conflicts with
the local people.
• (2) I support the comments from Land Department to change the land use status from
agriculture to residential/industrial and request the project to get the application
approved for site boundary.
• (3) I support the feedback from Women Affairs Department to water the road where
there is a potential dust generation, and to inform the local authority of the
transportation schedule.
• (4) Toeuk Phos deputy-governor requests for a new road (4km in length) as a
contribution to the communities, and the project.
• (5) The project employs the local residents for the project to increase economic
activities and incomes of the local people to reduce the out-migration of the people.
• (6) Department of Planning agrees with project as there is no resident on site.
122
123
• (7) On behalf of the provincial authority, I confidentially support this project and
request the project inform the authority of every development stages of the project. I
request all relevant departments provide support as needed to keep the project going
smoothly and effectively.
233. Overall responses: PRAC is contracted to build the 60MW Solar Plant within the EDC's
National Solar Park Project. The project information was already given in 60MW’s PIB and
presented in Slide and drafted ESIA report to everyone in the meeting today. PRAC builds,
operates and transfers the project after 20 years. Assessments and studies will be separately
conducted for other facilities. The consultation today is to inform you all about the Solar Plant
and its plans/schedules to complete it development plan. PRAC will need to recruit local staff
and workers and this will be done through local notices in the nearby villages and communes.
Photo 17: Provincial consultation on 19 October 2020
5.3 Information disclosure
234. Project Information Books (PIB) for 60MW Solar Plant provides meaningful
information sharing, consultations and active participation of concerned stakeholders. The
intention of this PIB is to prevent misconceptions on project impacts, project implementation
process and doubts or misconceptions on the project that may cause delays in project
implementation.
235. As above, the consultant team has recorded all information dissemination and
consultation activities and the results from consultations with the affected persons, including
how concerns raised and recommendations made are addressed in the ESIA and ESMP for the
60MW Solar Plant.
236. Consultations with concerned stakeholders will continue throughout project
implementation and will be open and gender inclusive.
237. The ESIA for 60MW Solar Plant will be disclosed on ADB website (www.adb.org) in
compliance with the ADB SPS 2009 and Access to Information Policy 2018. An updated
PIB/FAQ in Khmer were made available for the affected communities in public consultation
meetings, project construction field offices and commune offices.
5.4 Grievance redress mechanism
5.4.1 Awareness of Stakeholders
238. Initial consultations with relevant stakeholders potentially affected by the project were
conducted in May and July 2018 by EDC’s NSP IEE consultants before the commencement of
any project activity to inform them of the proposed project, potential temporary impacts and
project benefits. Two village consultations were held on 27 September 2020 by YRDC to
disseminate information about this 60 MW solar plant project and to discuss the concerns and
suggestions of potentially affected peoples.
239. A PIB containing preliminary information on GRM for 60MW solar plant was made
available at the time of the initial consultations
5.4.2 Need for Grievance Redress Mechanism
240. Since this project is funded by ADB and IFC and requires PRAC to establish a project
specific GRM for 60MW Solar Plant to provide an accessible platform for receiving and
facilitating resolution of complaints from affected persons on project implementation. GRM
will cover issues that may be raised on environmental issues such as temporary increase in
dust, noise or traffic causing inconvenience to local people, access to adjacent
properties/agricultural land or other relevant issues.
5.4.3 Current Scenario
241. The SECU of PMO (PRAC) is aware of the procedures of handling complaints/grievance
attributed to social or environmental issues based on several discussions and meetings with
ADB/IFC. SECU (PRAC) will proactively engage with affected persons and other relevant
stakeholders via a project community awareness program prior to start of civil works. The
program will cover the scope of the project, schedule of construction activities, identified
impacts and mitigation measures, health and safety issues and GRM. There will be ongoing
public consultation during project implementation as described in the ESMP.
5.4.4 Project GRM
242. Composition. Unless otherwise directed by EDC, PRAC will set up a Grievance Redress
Committee (GRC) as soon as the project commences. PRAC understands that EDC may require
it to participate in the GRM for the NSP and this section will therefore be redundant. The NSP
GRM and the PRAC GRC, if required, would function from construction commencement and
throughout the operations phase. The GRC will include the relevant local commune and/or
village chiefs. It will be headed by the PMO of PRAC through the duration of the project life.
124
125
Other members may include Provincial Officer or their nominee, District Officer from the
Cadastral office or their nominee, Contractor and a witness of the affected person; at least
one person in the GRC will be female.
243. Responsibilities. The GRC is expected to: (i) resolve issues on land acquisition (if any),
(ii) resolve issues on dust, noise, vibration, construction related nuisances to public, etc.; (iii)
convene once a month to review complaints lodged (if any); (iv) record the grievances and
resolve the issues within 30 days from the date the grievance was filed with the SECU; and (v)
report to the complainant(s)/affected persons the status of grievance resolution and the
decisions made or action taken.
244. Area of Jurisdiction. GRC will be established at provincial level (“Provincial GRC”) with
representation from commune councils across the project area of influence where the project
components will be implemented.
245. Procedures. The key contacts for the GRC will be posted at construction sites,
construction camps and public notice boards in affected communes in Khmer language. The
GRM will consist of the following steps of conflict resolution:
§ Step 1 – Any complaints by an affected person/complainant can be presented to the
commune council via village or commune chief, either verbally in person or in
writing.80 The village or commune chief will be obliged to provide immediate written
receipt of the complaint and take it forward in a written format and shared with the
SECU of PRAC.81 The SECU will resolve the issue within one week through negotiation.
The SECU will maintain records of complaint received and/or resolutions and submit it
to PMO as part of their monthly progress reports.
§ Step 2 – If or when the affected person/complainant is not satisfied with the action or
decision of the contractor, an affected person/complainant will take the issue to
PMO/PRAC via the commune council. In all cases, the grievances will be recorded in
writing and then forwarded to the SECU of PRAC. PRAC will have 15 days to resolve the
complaint through negotiation. If the issue is not handled within 15 days, or if the
complainant is not satisfied with the result, he/she can bring the issue to the District
office.
§ Step 3 – The District office has 15 days to negotiate the complaint and bring it into a
resolution. If the complaint cannot be resolved in a way that is satisfactory to all parties,
the District office will bring the issue to the provincial GRC.
§ Step 4 – The Provincial GRC will meet the affected person/complainant and try to
resolve the issue. Within 30 days of the submission of the complaint to the GRC, it has
to take a decision and inform in written both the affected person/complainant and
SECU/PRAC of the decision.
80 If affected persons do not have sufficient writing skills or are unable to express their grievances verbally, it is a common
practice that they are allowed to seek assistance from any recognized local NGO or other family members, village heads
or community chiefs to have their complaints or grievances written for them. affected persons will be allowed to have
access to the Detail measurement survey or contract document to ensure that all the details have been recorded
accurately enabling all parties to be treated fairly. Throughout the grievance redress process, the responsible committee
will ensure that the concerned affected persons are provided with copies of complaints and decisions or resolutions
reached.
81 Each contractor will designate a contractor GRM focal person (C-GRM)
§ Step 5 – If the affected person/complainant gets no response from the Provincial GRC
or is not satisfied with the result, he/she can bring the case to the Provincial Court.
The Court will make a written decision and submit copies to the executing and
implementing agencies. If any party is still unsatisfied with the Provincial Court
judgment, he/she can bring the case to a higher-level court.
§ Step 6 – If efforts to resolve disputes using the grievance procedures remain
unresolved or unsatisfactory, affected persons have the right to directly discuss their
concerns or problems with the ADB’s Energy Division, Southeast Asia Department or
through the ADB Cambodia Resident Mission (CARM) and IFC’s ombudsman office. If
affected persons are still not satisfied with the responses of the Division and/or CARM,
they can directly contact the ADB Office of the Special Project Facilitator through the
accountability mechanism82.
246. Recordkeeping and Reporting. SECU of PRAC will keep a record of all the grievances
received, including contact details of complainant, date the complaint was received, nature of
grievance, agreed corrective actions and the date these were affected, and final outcome.
Documentation of the grievances filed and resolved will be summarized and reported in
quarterly project progress reports and semi-annual safeguard reports.
247. Disclosure of Information. Under the direction of the PMO, the SECU will inform the
affected persons/complainants on grievance redress procedure, who to contact and when,
where and how to file a grievance, time likely to be taken for redressal of minor and major
grievances, etc. Grievances received and responses provided will be documented and
provided to the affected persons during the process. The number of grievances recorded and
resolved and the outcomes will be displayed/disclosed in the project field offices and
Commune council offices and Provisional Office (if required).
248. Review of the Process. The SECU of PRAC will periodically review the implementation
of the GRM and record information on the effectiveness of the mechanism, especially on the
project‘s ability to prevent and address grievances.
249. Cost of Implementation. Costs involved in resolving the complaints (meetings,
consultations, communication and reporting/information dissemination) will be borne by
PRAC.

CHAPTER 6: ANTICIPATED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
AND MITIGATION MEASURES
6.1 Impact Assessment
6.1.1 Impact identification
250. The study identified the impacts using three distinct methods: (i) checklist as required
by the Ministry of Environment as endorsed in 2009, (ii) matrix table assessing impacts against
project activities that potentially affect natural and socio-economic resources, and (iii)
overlaying method using ArcGIS. The information for overlaying was needed from existing and
fieldwork data (project and facility locations, residential/household locations, main
infrastructures on site, and critical sensitive receptors).
6.1.2 Impact significance assessment
(A) Impact significance
251. This is done based on three levels of significance (a) Low, (b) Moderate, (c) High in
according to each parameter in quantity and quality formats (if quantification is possible). The
analysis of the level of impact significance is discussed based on four main criteria as
illustrated below:
§ Spatial scale examines how much or far the impacts cover
§ Temporal scale identifies the duration of the impacts that can stay in the
environment
§ Magnitude of change/effect scale identifies the measures of scale of benefit/dis-
benefit of an impact or a condition
§ Reversibility scale defines whether the condition can be changed and is a measure
of the control over the effect of the condition

252. Assessing the impacts considers the “livelihood” and possibility of negative and
positive impacts and their consequences from project implementation. Waste risks were
determined and mitigations were proposed to minimize and manage them. Key impact

| AND MITIGATION MEASURES |

assessment procedures follow the following steps:
§ Step 1: Through consultation with experts and local communities, impacts could be
identified and assessed based on the four criteria above. These criteria ensured the
appropriateness and accuracy of the assessment methods. Score was given 1, 2, or 3
for each impact based on the information and data collected from the fieldwork and
the project information, and the field parameter testing (i.e. from certified
laboratories in Cambodia).
§ Step 2: Estimate and calculate the scores given to identify the level of key impact
significance, i.e. low, moderate or high.
§ Step 3: Impact significance were further assessed against the “Livelihood” criteria
which includes four levels – not likely happen, possibly happen, surely happen, and
will happen. Form this step, impact is finally rated as low, moderate or high again.
§ Step 4: Impact significance of the whole project was assessed in form of percentage to
assure how much impact significance is foreseen as low, moderate or high. Through
these steps, impacts are carefully screened and assessed with proven evidence and
discussions.
(C) Determining the mitigation measures
§ Avoidance: Avoiding impacts by modifying the design, process, location, footprint of
the project through an iterative process in order to prevent or limit a possible impact.
§ Minimization: Minimizing impacts by implementing decisions or activities that are
designed to reduce the undesirable impacts of a proposed activity on the surrounding
environment, including measures such as reducing the activity footprint,
implementing emissions reduction technology, etc.
§ Rectification: Continued monitoring to ensure measures continue to be effective at
preventing impact and progressively rehabilitating/restoring affected environment.
This would include attempts at habitat re-creation, to restore the original pre-mining
land uses and biodiversity values.
§ Compensation: Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute
resources or environment
(D) Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for 60MW Solar Plant
253. The ESMP covers both the construction, operations and decommission phase of the
project. For all the environmental and social risks and potential impacts identified in the ESIA,
management measures are recommended in the ESMP to prevent, minimize or offset these
impacts.
254. A preliminary budget and work plan for the management and monitoring activities are
included in the ESMP. PRAC agrees with the Royal Government of Cambodia regarding the
final budget for the ESMP implementation, and the Social and Environmental Fund.
(E) Contents of ESMP
255. As per Annex 1 of the MoE's Declaration on General Guideline for Developing IEIA/EIA
Report (2009) the contents of the ESMP covers the following:
§ Summary of negative impacts and reduction measures;
§ Training program
128
129
§ Environmental Monitoring Program for project construction phase, project operation
phase and project decommission phase, in which the project owner must state:
§ Monitoring agency for the project monitoring
§ Monitoring parameters
§ Methodology for monitoring
§ Environmental standards and guideline used for monitoring
§ Program and cycle for monitoring
§ Assessment of result of monitoring by project owner
§ Quarterly reports to submit to Ministry of Environment and one monitoring report to
the Lenders during construction and annual report in the later stages to the Lenders.
(F) Social and environmental fund
256. The project allocates some fund as required by the MoE's 1999 Sub-decree on IEIA/EIA
for the sake of protecting and rehabilitating the associated damages the project will cause.
PRAC will be responsible for allocating the fund in consultation with MoE during the
preparation for Environmental Contract before the agreement on ESIA report is approved.
6.2 Project Environmental Benefits
257. This project is expected to have significant environmental benefits. A transition to
clean solar energy generation will limit import dependence on coal and other fossil fuels, delay
or defer construction of new coal-fired plants and reduce reliance on hydropower
generation83. This would contribute to national emission reduction targets84 and reduced
pollution impacts. A 60 MW project will avoid approximately 84,000 tons of carbon dioxide-
equivalent (tCO2e) annually over a 20-year project lifetime.
6.3 Environmental Impact Screening
258. This section discusses potential environmental impacts in the context of the following
factors:
§ “Receptor”: the resource (human/natural environment/economic/social) that is
potentially going to receive and have to cope with an impact.
§ “Sensitivity”: ability to cope with an impact and/or its importance to Cambodia. It
is generally accepted that human health is always a high sensitivity receptor,
however in terms of environmental/natural resources, the sensitivity varies
according to the receptor e.g. scrubland with no significant biodiversity is
considered less sensitive than a water body which may support aquatic
ecosystems or the local biodiversity or livelihoods through fishing and/or tourism.
§ “Magnitude”: the size of the potential impact. Impacts may be short term and
considered low magnitude (e.g. noise, dust or vibration) or high magnitude and
long term (e.g. global and regional flyways of migratory birds).
259. Where an impact may occur, if there is no receptor to potentially receive the impact,
83 Cambodia now has a surplus of power generation in some hours in wet periods and at nighttime. Yet the national grid is
unable to meet daytime peak demand in high population areas such as Phnom Penh and experiences shortages during the
dry season when storage in hydropower reservoirs is limited.
84 https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/khmnc2.pdf
then mitigating actions are not required. This follows the source-pathway-receptor model,
whereby in order for there to be an impact, the pollutant or issue (source) needs to be present,
the pathway to a receptor is needed (such as water for human consumption) and a receptor
must be present to receive the impact, such as humans, flora or fauna.
260. Environmental impacts were assessed across all stages of project implementation i.e.
(i) design and pre-construction stage, (ii) construction stage, and (iii) operation stage. Potential
cumulative and induced impacts from further planned development of the project and other
sources of similar impacts were also considered.
6.4 Pre-Construction Stage
261. The potential adverse environmental impacts associated with the project are avoided
or minimized by: (i) careful site selection and route alignment by EDC for the NSP and its
associated infrastructure; (ii) PRAC integrating key measures that will permanently become
part of its plant through inclusion in the project detailed engineering design; (iii)
implementation of environmental mitigation measures for identified impacts; and (iv)
ensuring project environment management readiness.85 These are as follows:
6.4.1 Site and Route Selection.
262. A critical issue for the management of impacts on identified receptors, particularly: a)
households areas/structures, b) surface water sources, c) groundwater wells, d) road and
railway crossings, e) global and regional flyways of migratory birds, f) protected areas, habitats
and species of conservation value, and g) physical cultural resources (PCRs).
263. EDC and ADB undertook a Pre-Feasibility Study86 to assess site and route options for
the NSP project. The preferred NSP site and route were selected to avoid sensitive receptors
such as protected areas, habitats and species of conservation value, hospitals/clinics/schools,
PCRs as well as to minimize impacts on human health, households, crops and trees of
economic value.
6.4.2 Land Requirements
264. Land purchase. The PRAC’s 60 MW solar plant will be constructed on 97 ha of land
leased from EDC, which purchased the land from owners through a negotiated process at
martket rates and on a willing seller willing buyer basis. EDC has informed Council for
Development of Cambodia (CDC) about the progress of the land aquisition in a letter dated
on 27 October 2020. For the 60 MW Solar Plant, the 27 land plots (combining together to get
102 ha) have been already purchased and being procedured to transfer ownership rights from
buyers (i.e. villagers) to EDC. The purchase has been conducted with the villagers on a willing-
to-sell-buy basis with contracts and agreements prior to the payment.
265. In September 2020, EDC commissioned an external independent expert. A local law
firm undertook a review of the procurement process for the solar plant land (phase 1 of
85 Project design is discussed in detail in the project Feasibility Study while Climate Risks and Vulnerability Analysis is enclosed
as Appendix IV.

National Solar Park), which determined that negotiations were free, fair, transparent and did
not cause involuntary displacement impacts. The third part assessment report87 (September
2020) concludes that:
- The land is partly owned by a company and partly owned by individuals.
- The land acquired by EDC does not adversely impact the business or livelihoods of
sellers or their families. The landowners are not identified as vulnerable or have land
based livelihoods.
- No land plots have residential or commercial properties on the land.
- It is reported that the affected persons expressed satisfaction withe provided rates,
and that the land acquired is free from any encumbrances (including encroachment,
squatters etc.) and outstanding comlaints.
- It is verified that the landowners willingly agreed to sell the land plots and the price
for affected land and assets were negotiated with the affected persons without
coercion.
266. There is no temporary land aquisition associated with the solar plant; all civil works
will be undertaken within the solar plant acquired area.
6.4.3 Training and Capacity Building
267. Training and Capacity Building.88 The capacity of PRAC PMO and its contractors
responsible for ESMP implementation, GRM and supervision will be strengthened. The
capacities of PMO of PRAC and contractors to coordinate environmental management will be
strengthened through a set of measures:
§ Appointment of at least one environment focal person and one social focal person
within the PMO to be in charge of ESMP coordination, implementation and site
inspections including project GRM
§ Appointment of at least one environment, health and safety officer (“C-EHS”) within
the contractor staff to be in charge of ESMP coordination, implementation, site
inspections and information disclosure and consultations
§ Appointment of at least one GRM focal person (“C-GRM”) to be in charge of project
GRM coordination, handling complaints, dispute resolution, site visits and
information disclosure and consultations
268. PRAC PMO will provide training on ESMP implementation, supervision, monitoring and
reporting, project GRM, conducting meaningful consultations and relevant environmental
rules and regulation. In addition, orientation and briefing of project staff, all contractors/sub-
contractors, hired workers will be conducted prior to mobilization on site during construction
and operation stages.
269. Mitigation measures defined in this ESIA and ESMP are based on final detailed
engineering design. Site-specific checklists are developed in ESMP to use in monitoring
environmental compliance during construction and operation.
87 The third part assessment report considers land aquisition for 130.92 hectares which covers the Project (60MW Solar PV
Project) land requirements, Phase 2 (40MW Solar PV Project) land requirements, and land required for the construction
works (fencing, roads, and drainage systems) and shared facilities within the solar park.

6.5 Construction Stage
There will be some impacts identified during the construction. Impacts on land, vegetation,
air, water, waste or physical resources have been detected in association with the Project's
activities and presences of workers, staff and contractors. The identified environmental and
social impacts are detailed in the following section. The immediate description (A-B-C-D) is
the PRAC's overall plan to manage staff, contractors and workers to avoid any unprecendeted
impacts from their stay during the construction stage.
(A) Orientation for Project Staff, Contractors, Workers
270. Prior to mobilizing on site, the SECU and PMO of PRAC will conduct briefing and
orientation for all project staff and tumkey contractors/sub-contractors. Engineering,
Procurement, and construction (EPC), and Project Implementation Consultant (PIC) of EDC’s
National Solar Park will invited to observe the orientation. The following information will be
disseminated :
§ ESMP, GRM, Information disclosure and meaningful consultation, environmental
monitoring and reporting requirements
§ ADB/IFC and Cambodia labor standards
§ Responsibilities of the contractors in developing and implementing the site-specific
CEMPs, SOPs and monitoring environmental compliance with the ESMP 89/CEMP;
§ Responsibility of the contractors in engaging with affected persons for project GRM
§ Create awareness of sexually-transmitted diseases (HIV/AIDs), child labor, bonded
labor or forced labor
§ Record and maintain briefing and orientation events log with duration and list of
attendees
§ Under the supervision of the PIC and prior to mobilizing on site, contractors will
conduct training and drills for workers on:
o CEMP sub-plans implementation
o Environmental, health and safety and hygiene at work sites as well as sexually
transmitted disease such as HIV/AIDS to prevent potential incidences
o Record and maintain briefing and orientation events log with duration and list
of attendees
(B) Hiring Of Project Staff and Workers
271. Project implementation will bring opportunities for local employment. While this is
beneficial, it may also be a cause of conflict over transparency of hiring particularly if migrant
workers are recruited over local people. The PRAC's sub-contractors will be required to use
local labor for manual work and eligible local workforce for technical and administrative jobs.
(C) Presence of Workers at Construction Sites
272. The presence of workers and staff at the project sites may increase demand for
services such as food and beverages. The localized demand of services may result in an
opportunity for local communities to set up temporary small-scale business in providing food
89 PIC will develop checklists for use in monitoring environmental compliance during construction stage.
132
133
and beverages outside the solar plant. This will be a beneficial impact to local economy.
(D) Preparation of Construction Environmental Management Plans/Standard Operating
Procedures for 60MW solar plant
273. The CEMP of 60MW solar plant will help to avoid unplanned activities of PRAC’s
contractors and will guide the smooth implementation of all project activities. Prior to
mobilizing on site, PRAC will develop a site-specific CEMP for the key activities; appropriate
maps showing where activities will take place and corresponding implementation schedule.
The Plant’s CEMP will follow the advice of National Solar Park’s PIC who will prepare the
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the whole National Solar Park in line with the
environmental component likely to be affected.90 The Plant’s CEMP will include the sub-plans
listed in Table 35 and will be submitted to PMO for approval.

6.5.1 Physical Landscape
274. 60MW solar plant will involve vegetation clearance and soil compaction. Due to the
topographical location of the project and the surrounding forest cover, the changes to physical
landscape in the project development area will not be visible or have an impact beyond the
project’s immediate vicinity.
275. This is because the 60MW solar plant site has been historically modified for use as
cassava plantations. The 60MW solar plant has been designed to minimize adverse physical
impacts to the surrounding landscape by minimizing the Project Footprint and blending major
project components with the surrounds to the extent practicable.
6.5.2 Topography
276. Land leveling and grading works may alter drainage patterns at the solar plant site that
may result in surface erosion, generation of spoil and localized flooding. Impacts will also
result from installation of equipment, installation of cable routes (above ground and/or
underground) and commissioning of new equipment. These impacts will be temporary and
localized at the construction sites within the solar plant.
277. Management measures
§ Clear demarcation of work sites, no encroachment outside the demarcated zone
§ Access to adjacent properties and agricultural land will be maintained, as necessary
§ Construction camp/ workers accommodation set up at least 100 m from natural
streams or any other water source at site including drainage/irrigation canals and
dykes. Workers’ accommodation: processes and standards—a guidance will be
referred to at the time of construction91.
§ Implement engineering and biological measures to prevent surface erosion such as
provision of silt traps or sowing soil-binding grass, as needed.
§ Restore loose soil from foundations through ramming, if required
§ Implement the following CEMP sub-plans
§ Spoils Disposal Plan92
§ Drainage and Storm-water Management Plan
278. Site Rehabilitation and Clean up Plan after completion of civil works to restore works
site to pre-construction conditions including landscaping along the fenced perimeter, maintain
hedges and field margins to reduce visual and dust impact, re-seeding most or all of the site
with native plant species (soil binding grass) to stabilize the soil and restore habitat
6.5.3 Air Quality
279. Potential air quality impacts during construction include dust emissions associated
with earthworks and gaseous emissions from construction activities and heavy vehicles used
to support the construction works. Some concerning activities are wind-borne dust emissions
from cleared areas, stockpiles, and unpaved site roads; truck-derived dust emissions from
91 The guideline can be retrieved from
https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/sustainability-at-
ifc/publications/publications_gpn_workersaccommodation
92 Excess spoil will be backfilled onsite or temporary / permanently disposed as per the clearly identified disposal sites on
site specific map, with corresponding distance and number of trips made will be maintained (this will help avoid disposal
of spoil on farm land or within 400 m of any water source).
134
135
traffic on haulage routes and dumping; and dozer- and excavator-derived dust emissions from
clearing operations and earthworks.
280. Moderate temporary air quality impacts during peak construction phase of the project
are anticipated because of construction activities scheduled in the dry season and due to
fugitive dust generation associated with construction works and transport (of materials,
equipment and machinery), loading, unloading and haulage of materials and corresponding
increase in vehicular emissions. Use of construction machinery and equipment and movement
of transport vehicles may also levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), affecting
air quality. Building access roads to project site (asphalt road pavement) will produce fumes
containing small quantities of toxic and hazardous chemicals such as volatile organic
compounds (VOC) and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).
281. Management measures
§ Particulate dust generation will be minimized by restricting land clearing to the areas
flagged for immediate use, progressively rehabilitating exposed soils as soon as
practicable, avoiding clearing and earthworks activities during dry, windy conditions,
and applying water to all cleared, road and stockpile areas whenever weather
conditions have the potential to mobilize fugitive dust. Open burning (e.g. of
vegetation, waste, hydrocarbons) will be avoided.
§ A detailed management and monitoring plan for air quality is provided in the
Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the Project, which will monitor
emissions generated during construction.
§ General air quality management and mitigation measures are as follows.
• Conduct awareness training on dust emissions for project employees and
workforce
• Restrict speed limit on unsealed roads to minimize dust generation
• Conduct topsoil stripping when soil is moist to the extent practical
• Monitor for air quality impacts near sensitive receptors identified near
construction areas and along the access roads
• Use low-sulphur fuels where practical
• Source low-emission diesel equipment (e.g. Tier 2 or better) where practical
§ The contractors will conduct air quality monitoring at the solar plant site once before
start of the civil works to establish the baseline, bi-monthly during the civil works and
once after completion of the civil works to monitor and mitigate exceedances (if any)
with respect to the Ambient Air Quality Standards (see Table below).

§ Air monitoring will be conducted utilizing hand held air monitoring devices at select
locations identified on site map as the samples collected during the assessment.
§ Open and exposed land areas at the solar plant site will be sprayed with water to
suppress dust levels particularly during the dry season.
§ Use of chemical dust suppressants will be prohibited.
§ Aside from this, works sites will be temporarily barricaded to enclose to control dust
levels
§ Storage areas/warehouse for materials required for construction and civil works will
be provided onsite (construction camps at the solar plant) to reduce construction
vehicle trips of transporting materials and minimize stockpiling
§ Vehicles transporting materials that generate dusts will be covered with tarps.
Construction vehicles and machinery will be maintained to a high standard to minimize
vehicular emissions and noise.
§ Log of monitoring/incidences of non-compliance and rectification will be recorded and
maintained.
6.5.4 Noise and vibration
282. Noise impacts will be temporary and localized at all construction sites as construction
machinery and vehicles generate noise as they operate. Other noise sources include loading,
unloading and haulage of equipment and materials. Significant noise impacts will be
experienced by construction site workers/operators; construction machinery may produce
noise levels up to 90 A-weighted decibels (dBA). For the solar plant site, only construction
workers will be this close to the machinery for extended periods of time. Measurement of
noise levels at the 60 MW solar plant site was conducted once prior to start of the civil works
to establish the baseline, bi-monthly during the civil works and once after completion of the
civil works (the latter will be conducted at the 60 MW solar plant site only/upon
commissioning of the substation) to monitor and mitigate exceedances (if any), with respect
to the Ambient Noise Standards. The potential impacts due to noise and vibration will be
mitigated by the following measures as set out in the ESMP.
283. Potential vibration and noise impacts include those associated with vehicle
movements, heavy machinery and construction activities. Since there are no nearby residents
within 3km around the project, potential noise and vibration impacts are primarily issues for
workers onsite. Sources of noise and vibration associated with project construction include:
• Light vehicle movements associated with personnel arrival/departure and onsite
activities
• Earthworks in the Project area using heavy machinery (clearing, grubbing and cutting)
• Earthworks associated with upgrade of the project internal roads
• Concrete foundation works
• Building and facility construction
• Heavy vehicle movements associated with delivery of equipment, building materials,
and infrastructure
284. Management measures

137
• Noise and vibration associated with vehicles will be minimized by imposing a
speed limit on site roads, by scheduling the majority of vehicle movements to
daylight hours, minimizing air/exhaust braking where this would cause
disturbance, and establishing soil berms or vegetation along roads to reduce
the impact of traffic noise.
• Equipment with lower noise levels will be selected where practical, vibration
isolation and acoustic enclosures will be installed for mechanical equipment as
needed, and the operation of noisy equipment will be limited to daylight hours
where practical.
• Install soil berms or vegetation along roads as needed to reduce the impact of
traffic noise.
• Schedule project supply deliveries to daylight hours
• Maintain road surface to reduce rumble
• Conduct periodic noise and vibration monitoring at the solar plant site once
before start of the civil works to establish the baseline, bi-monthly during the
civil works and once after completion of the civil works to monitor and mitigate
exceedances (if any) with respect to the Noise/Vibration Standards (see Table
below).

§ Drivers will be required to observe low speed wherever necessary and no blowing of
horns.
§ Construction activities utilizing heavy machinery work will be restricted between 8 AM
– 6 PM.
§ Advance warning to communities will be provided with respect to the timing of noisy
activities.
§ Construction vehicles and machinery will be maintained to a high standard to minimize
emissions and noise.
§ All construction workers/operators will use appropriate PPE including ear defenders
when operating machinery.
§ Implement CEMP Sub-plans:
§ The Noise and Dust Control Plan
§ Traffic and Road Management Plan
6.5.5 Surface Water Quality
285. During construction, sediment management will be critical to prevent water quality
impacts due to erosion and suspended sediment transport impacts associated with land

clearance and major earthworks. The removal of vegetation on site and along watercourses
could increase erosion and impact local aquatic biodiversity. Surface and near-surface waters
near the project area are contaminated and will require management and/or treatment.
286. Any accidental spills of fuel, grey water or septic systems could potentially contaminate
receiving waters. Wastes from construction activities have minimal potential to affect the
water quality in the Praek Mkak and other water bodies if unmanaged. Significant generation
of construction waste is expected during this phase from land clearance, construction activity,
and workforce activities. The potential surface water quality impacts associated with the
Project construction phase and which are to be managed by the project include:
• Erosion and sedimentation as a result of earthworks and land clearing
• Release of oil, grease and hydrocarbon pollution associated with vehicles and
heavy machinery
• Release of pathogen and nutrient pollution associated with human activity,
accommodation, sewage treatment and putrescible waste
287. Management measures
• To the extent practical, earthworks will be avoided during the wet season and
periods of heavy rain, unless earthworks are needed to prevent erosion;
• Clearance of vegetation from water courses will be avoided wherever practical,
leaving a minimum 100m of undisturbed riparian/forest cover on both sides of
watercourses within the project area
• Use of herbicides/pesticides will be prohibited for vegetation clearing to
prevent soil contamination
• All waste from land clearing, building activities, and accommodation will be
collected, stored and disposed of safely in a manner that prevents any release
of leachate into the Praek Mkak
• All chemicals and hydrocarbons will be handled and stored appropriately
according to the ESMP and associated standard operation procedures, with
adequate bunding, inspection, auditing and contingency measures
• Mandatory personnel inductions will include awareness of water pollution
issues and management, and project regulations will be enacted to prevent
polluting activities that may pose a threat to the Praek Mkak
• Surface water quality monitoring will be conducted at the solar plant site and
the downstream of An Long Chrey reservoir once before start of the civil works
to establish the baseline, once during the civil works and once after completion
of the civil works to ascertain if any changes have occurred with respect to
MoE's Surface Water Quality Standards (see Table below).

• No washing or repair of equipment/machinery will take within 100 meters of
any water source.
• Provision for a temporary secured hazardous materials handling and waste
storage area will be provided across all work sites including site for broken and
redundant solar panels.
• Provision for a temporary secured hazardous materials handling and waste

• Implement CEMP Sub-plan
• Drainage and Storm-water Management Plan
288. All activities will be supervised by PMO’s HS officer, Environment Officer, Social Officer
and monitored by PMO of PRAC.
6.5.6 Groundwater Quality
289. There are some potential effluences for groundwater contamination, i.e.
contamination of soil and groundwater with oil, grease and hydrocarbon pollution associated
with vehicles and heavy machinery; and with pathogen and nutrient pollution associated with
human activity, accommodation, sewage treatment and putrescible waste.
290. Management measures
• All chemicals and hydrocarbons will be handled and stored appropriately
according to the ESMP and associated standard operation procedures, with
adequate bunding, hardstand preparation including lining, concreting or
compaction, as well as inspection, auditing and contingency measures.
• Septic tank will be installed to keep contain wastewater from toilets and

kitchens to prevent pollution to groundwater.
• Groundwater quality is to be monitored once before start of the civil works to
establish the baseline, once during the civil works and once after completion
of the civil works. Important quality parameters to be monitored are EC,
Turbidity, TDS, Total Hardness, Flouride, NO3, SO4, CL, E-Coli, Al, As, Cd, Cr, Fe,
Hg, and Mn.
6.5.7 Hydrology
291. The predicted impacts on hydrology associated with the Project construction phase
and which are to be managed by the Project include:
• Increased surface runoff from the developed areas of the catchment
• Slightly altered flow regime in ephemeral waterways downstream of Praek
Mkak
• Water abstraction from the Praek Mkak may be required to support
construction activities
292. Management measures
• The project has been designed to minimize long-term negative impacts to
surface water drainage, flood risk levels, and local hydrology within and
downstream of the project area.
• Surface runoff from developed areas of the project is to be controlled by the
installation of drainage channels, and contained by the construction of
(sedimentation) ponds in order to minimize erosion and flood risk.
• Monitoring the surrounding hydrology will be conducted for every six months
6.5.8 Soil Quality
293. Vegetation on the 60 MW Plant site will be cleared in preparation for the construction
of project components. Measures are therefore required to minimize soil erosion (by rain and
wind) and prevent sediment release to the Praek Mkak. Soil compaction within active
construction areas is likely due to heavy traffic passage and construction activities. Soil
contamination from accidental leaks/spills of hydrocarbons, oil, grease, chemicals and
sewage/wastewater effluent is also possible and will require management.
294. Management measures
• The project has been designed to minimize long-term negative impacts to soil
function in the project site by recovering topsoil stripped from clearing and
construction activities and subsequently for progressive and final rehabilitation.
• Land clearing is to be limited to the immediate project site required for
development to the extent practical
• Activities involving chemicals or hydrocarbons (including storage of broken and
redundant solar panels) are to be restricted to designated areas that have been
prepared with appropriate bunding, a concrete or compacted earth base, and
fully contained by drainage controls
• An appropriate sanitation system is to be provided to collect all waste and
sewage for proper storage and disposal;
• Strict controls on the use of sanitation facilities will be implemented through
education and enforcement.
140
141
• Soil quality monitoring will be conducted for every six months.
6.5.9 Waste Generation
295. Impacts due to waste generation during construction stage have been assessed for all
infrastructure types under the 60 MW solar plant and discussed as follows. Impacts on
resource use and impacts associated with disposal will arise from waste generated during site
preparation and civil works. This includes generation of inert wastes e.g. spoil, biodegradable
wastes e.g. cleared vegetation, construction debris, packaging waste, metal scrap, domestic
waste. Impacts of disposal and wind-blown litter will be seen at the construction areas
whereas the impacts of resource use are national and global.
296. Management measure
§ Compliance with Sub-decree No. 36 ANRK.BK on Solid Waste Management, MOE, 1999
§ For broken/redundant solar panels, there will be proper storages for each type of
disposal. The final disposal of redundant/broken panels will be sent to recycling
process depending on types of disposal.
§ Establish a covered onsite storing, sorting, and recycling area away from existing water
sources, drainage /irrigation canals or water sources. This includes an area to store
broken and redundant solar panels.
§ Transport of recyclables, scrap, discarded equipment to PRAC depots, dedicated
storage yards for resale or auction to authorized dealers. The broken or damaged solar
parnels will be sold to a solar planel specializing in recycling.
§ For other type of wastes, licensed companies will be hired to collect, transport and
dispose of wastes at licensed dump facilities
§ Biodegradable waste such as cleared vegetation may be provided to local communities
for use
§ Provide multiple waste containers at construction camps
§ Waste burning will be prohibited
§ No final waste disposal on site
6.5.10 Biological Impacts
297. A biodiversity assessment has been carried out for the project; the flora and fauna
recorded during the data search, ground surveys and consultations did not reveal the
presence of species or habitats of particular conservation value within the project area of
influence.
298. There are no protected areas or community forests in or around the solar plant site.
The Phnom Aural NPA is located within 20 km of the solar plant site and 300 ha Tbeng Srong
community forest in Chhean Laeung commune is located approximately 5-7 km from the solar
plant site in the northeast direction. Local interviews with villagers in the Chaen Laeung
commune, which borders the Tbeng Srong community forest have suggested the possible
presence of endangered and vulnerable species of mammals and reptiles in the forest such as
Dhole, Fishing Cat, Asiatic Jackal, and Burmese Python. The interviewed locals also suggested
possible presence of rich bird species diversity (species found typically in forested areas,
wetlands and rural areas)93. No direct or indirect adverse impacts are anticipated on the
national protected area (NPA) or the community forest as a result of construction activities at
the solar plant site. Construction impacts on terrestrial flora and fauna within the solar plant
site will be negligible because the site is located in areas of modified habitat consisting of
paddy fields and scrubland94 disturbed by human activity.
6.5.11 Vegetation impacts
299. The most significant impact to terrestrial habitats and flora associated with the project
is expected to occur during the Construction Phase when habitats within the project footprint
will be cleared. The project site is located further away (16km) on the south-eastern part of
the Phnom Aural Wildlife Sanctuary (PAWS), therefore habitat clearance will not result in the
loss of natural and modified habitats from within the PAWS or even within the project site
since the area has been long modified and no critical habitats are found.
300. Management measures
• Construction camps to be set up at least 100m from any water source,
drainage/irrigation canals or dykes
• Access to adjacent properties and agricultural land will be maintained, as
necessary
• Vegetation clearances will be strictly restricted to work sites
• Use of herbicides/pesticides will be prohibited for vegetation clearing to
prevent soil contamination
• Excess spoil will be backfilled onsite or spread out in a manner that causes no
disturbance to existing drainage/irrigation canals, dykes or local drainage
pattern
• Implement the following CEMP sub-plans
• Strictly implement the Spoils Disposal plan95
• Drainage and Storm-water Management Plan
• Site Rehabilitation and Clean-up Plan after completion of civil works to pre-
construction conditions including vegetation planting to stabilize soil where it
does not compromise the intended function.
• Vegetation monitoring will be monitoring for six months during the
construction period.
6.5.12 Fauna Impacts
301. The significant impact to priority fauna will be the loss of a proportion of their habitat
during construction. This impact will largely be localized and restricted to the approximately
97 ha of modified habitat to be removed for project. As preparatory works begin, the on-site
species will move into other parts of their range. Other priority birds, reptiles and small
mammals have a wide habitat tolerance and are likely to move into similar habitat elsewhere.
93 The interviewee said the observations were in the last five years and there has been a decline in sightings due to change
in land use and hunting.
94 Solar park site is mainly scrubland (293 ha) and paddy fields (116 ha); small plantations such as cassava, mango, cashew,
eucalyptus and bamboo.
95 Excess spoil will be backfilled onsite or temporary/permanently disposed as per the clearly identified disposal sites on site
specific map, with corresponding distance and number of trips made will be maintained (this will help avoid disposal of
spoil on farm land or within 400 m of any water source).
142
143
302. Management measures
• The project will design a plant layout to avoid most sensitive habitats including
maintaining the buffer zone for instance to keep habitats as possible.
• The project will avoid direct and indirect impacts to areas of biodiversity
sensitivity (e.g. Praek Mkak).
• Habitat clearance will be undertaken in a progressive and sensitive manner to
enable priority fauna to move away from the area of works and to avoid
isolating fauna in fragmented areas of habitat.
• Adverse impact to habitats, flora and fauna arising from fugitive dust will be
minimized through the regular application of water to reduce dust levels in
areas of biodiversity sensitivity (particularly during the dry season), the
stabilization of landforms, and the implementation of erosion prevention
measures.
• Raise awareness with workforce and local villagers about importance of
protecting forest resources and conservation important species and their
habitats.
• Fauna monitoring will be conducted for six months during this construction
peroid.
6.5.13 Fishery and other aquatic biodiversity
303. The Praek Mkak is a closed tributary of the An Long Chrey reservoir and provides
significant aquatic habitat and ecosystem services. Several minor ephemeral creeks in and
around the project site will be slightly modified for the construction of associated components.
Vegetated areas occurring within the Project Footprint will also be cleared. Potential impacts
therefore include:
• Release of suspended sediment from construction activities
• Clearing or modification of watercourses in the project site
• Accidental spills of diesel fuel
304. Management measures
• The project design minimizes potential impacts to aquatic habitat by
minimizing the construction footprint, which avoids local wetlands and
waterways to the extent possible and primarily drains into a single catchment
– Praek Mkak.
• Riparian habitats will be retained where possible to maintain a degree of
functionality, including a 100 m buffer zone around watercourses
• Proper transport, storage, handling and disposal procedures for hazardous
substances will be developed and implemented to prevent spills and leaks
entering the Praek Mkak and tributaries.
• Personnel and contractors will be prohibited, as a condition of employment,
from fishing and trading in aquatic natural resources.
305. The potential impacts on ecological resources will be mitigated by the following
measures as set out in the ESMP:
• Minimize vegetation clearing confined to the footprint of the solar plant area
• No use of chemicals (pesticides/herbicides)
• Maintain hedges and field margins along the solar plant perimeter
• After completion of civil works, implement Site Rehabilitation and Clean Up
Plan including landscaping along the fenced perimeter of the solar plant, re-
seeding most or all of the site with native species of plants
• Provision for adequate ground clearance under fencing for allowing passage of
animals/wild species to prevent habitat fragmentation
• Restoring temporarily disturbed areas to pre-construction conditions
• Any identified bat roosting sites will not be disturbed
• Monitoring to the fishery resource will be conducted for six months.
6.5.14 Local Economic Development and Employment
• Despite the generally positive impact the Project will have on economic
development and short-term local employment during construction, there is a
risk of inequitable employment, training and procurement opportunities or
inadequate communication leading to community dissatisfaction.
• As management measures, the project will develop a preferential local
recruitment, training and procurement plans and procedures in accordance
with NSP advice and requirements. Implementation of social management and
monitoring as per the ESMP and sub-plans: Stakeholder Engagement Plan, and
Grievance Mechanism.
6.5.15 Agricultural Land Use
• The Project will not directly or indirectly impact on agriculture-based
livelihoods of the local communities in the area of influence.
6.5.16 Forest Resource Use
306. Project construction will result in the removal of small bushes in the project footprint,
exclusion of the public from the project site and its resources, and the potential for increased
pressure on forest resources from local villagers.
307. Management measure
• The project will demarcate the project boundary and avoid the key community
forest collection areas when siting infrastructure in the Project design.
• The project will ban on unauthorized collection of forest resources, including
plants, and firewood within and around the project areas.
• The project will set up a grievance mechanism.
• The project will monitor the vegetation clearance to avoid any vast and
unnecessary clearance.
6.5.17 Water Uses
308. There is a slight risk to downstream water users related to the possibility of impacts
on water quality associated with project construction activities including contamination of
water resources with sediment and chemicals such as diesel, grease and oil. Other impacts
may arise from modifications to local creeks/drainages. Groundwater is not a significant
source of water for the project, and no significant impacts on groundwater quality or
availability are expected during the construction phase.
144
145
309. Management measures
• All hydrocarbons, oils and greases and other hazardous materials will be
handled, stored and used in designated areas according to standard operation
procedures with adequate bunding, hardstand preparation (e.g. lining,
concreting or compaction), inspection, auditing and contingency measure
• Mandatory personnel inductions will include awareness of water pollution
issues and management.
6.5.18 Occupational Health and Safety
310. During the construction phase, more workers will be employed to support project
construction, to be housed on site in the Project's temporary worker's camp. The key factors
that will pose risks to worker health and safety are movement of heavy machinery and high
volumes of traffic on site. The main risks to worker health and safety and other risks such as
fire.
311. Management measures:
• The project will demarcate exclusion and safety zones around high risk area.
• The project will strictly require all workers wear personal protective equipment
appropriate to their duties with signage at designated sites.
• Clinical assistance will be available to project personnel and medical
emergency evacuation procedures will be developed.
• Fatigue will be monitored and managed during travel and during on site
operations.
• Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the safe handling, storage and
transportation of associated facilities and materials.
• The project will strictly implement the management and monitoring measures
as per ESMP for water quality, waste management, air, health and safety, noise
and vibration and transport measures.
• Implement CEMP sub-plan on Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Plan
• Establish and implement ERPs as required
• Compliance with Cambodia Occupational Safety and Health laws and
regulations, Department of Safety and Health, Ministry of Labour and
Vocational Training (MLVT), 201196

months)
• Periodic training will be provided to workers in all aspects of the ERP and OHS
• For infectious disease, there will be training to all workers for self-prevention,
clean living, and regularly (once per day) fogging activities at the temporary
workers camp for mosquito control.
• Coordinate with nearest hospital for arrangements in case of accidents
• provide first aid treatment for construction sites and camp
• Assess safety risks and safety protocols (such as for electrical works, working at
heights, etc.), and implement
• Workers will be equipped with PPE including proper safety clothes and

protection gear/equipment to avoid accidents
• Provide communication devices to designated site officers / engineers
• Electrical safety risks will be assessed and safety protocols will be developed
and implemented such as for electrical works, working at heights, etc.
• All works at height will be prohibited during night time, periods off fog and
strong wind on the Beaurfort Wind Scale97
• All workers climbing towers will have a Safety Certificate of Class 398 or above
• All towers, steel structures and equipment will be properly earthed and
equipped with lightening protection
• When testing electrical equipment, all unrelated works in the flagged zone –
marked as danger zone - will be stopped and unrelated workers will leave the
zone
• Records of health assessments/incidents/accidents/near-miss/fatalities will be
maintained
6.5.19 Community Health and Safety
312. Site preparation and civil works, movement of vehicles bringing equipment, materials,
supplies and machinery may interfere with road crossings, flow of traffic and may cause an
increase in traffic congestion. These activities may pose safety risks to the communities
residing in close proximity to the work sites and general public. In addition, construction
camps and an influx of workers may cause social conflict or even lead to the spread of any
comunicable diseases. Contractors will obtain permissions from relevant authorities before
commencement of activities. A code of conduct will be developed for all relevant stakeholder
and workers to keep the work organized and safe in the ESMP.
313. The Project may also generate (fugitive) dust mainly from upgrading the access road,
clearing the forestland for infrastructure, and transportation of materials and equipment.
Noise from these activities may also disturb nearby residents at night as well as impact on
daily economic/business activities. Also, during the Construction Phase, the project may lead
to a number of key risks for community health, food security and safety, including:
• Safety impacts will be primarily associated with accidents involving company
vehicles along the project access road. During construction in particular, there
will be a significant increase in project traffic.
• Potential psycho-social and health impacts among Project personnel
associated with air quality, noise, and vibration effects.
314. Management measures
• Enforce the workers' code of conduct to avoid conflicts, and prevent sexual
exploitation and harrassment among workers and community members.
97The Beaufort Wind Scale is an empirical measure with 12 wind speed classes. Winds above Class V are higher than 10.8
m/sec.
98Electric Safety Classification is regulated in Circular 31/2014/TT-BCT (2014). The Circular stipulates five Safety Classifications
(1 to 5), with 5 being the highest. A Class 3 Safety Certificate designates a worker capable of working in the field, and is
given to workers/technicians who: 1) pass 80% of the training; 2) have knowledge of the proper use of PPE; 3) master the
method to extract an electrocuted victim from the power source; 4) can provide first aid to an electrocuted victim; 5) is
able to determine unsafe practices; and 6) is able to supervise electric workers working at height and near electric
equipment.
146
147
• Develop the Worker Influx Plan to enforce measures to avoid and manage
infectious diseases.
• Security fencing and patrols to prevent safety impacts from any construction
activities undertaken during construction.
• Potential noise impacts will be reduced to acceptable levels through scheduled
daytime construction, while dust generation will be managed through regular
water spraying on major dust sources associated with the project.
• The project will strictly implement the management and monitoring measures
as per ESMP for water quality, waste management, air, health and safety, noise
and vibration, and transportation; and sub-plans including Emergency
Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP), Community Health and Safety Plan,
Stakeholder Engagement Plan, Traffic and Transport Management Plan, and
Waste Management Plan.
• Provide healthcare services for project employees with an appropriately
staffed site clinic99.
• Effectively control the risks associated with accidents involving multiple
vehicles, interactions between different types of vehicles with consideration
for the volume and speed of traffic, and vehicle and person interactions.
• Obeying speed limits and applying additional caution by considering
environmental conditions such as time of day, visibility, precipitation.

drainage to prevent the incidence of vector-borne and water-related diseases
• Develop a management strategy for worker accommodation in line with
international/national standards to minimize spread of infectious disease and
food-related illnesses.
• Adhere to strict schedule for completion of civil works and avoid prolonged
construction and disturbance
• Implement CEMP Sub-plans
• Community Health and Safety Plan
• Traffic and Road Management Plan
• Provide perimeter fencing to mitigate trespassing (fencing will be constructed
with adequate ground clearance for passing of wild animals/other species at
the solar plant site)
• Provide barricade to temporarily enclose open excavated tower foundations
• Provide sufficient lights, clear warning signs and danger signals
• Assign security personnel to prevent accidents, trespassing and pilferage
• Warning signs and cones will be installed in and around the transmission tower
site and along roads, with clearly marked danger zones

• Record of incidents/accidents/near-miss/fatalities associated with the project
will be maintained
• Records of issues raised will be maintained in accordance with GRMs
• Outreach to local communities to disseminate knowledge about safety and
ERPs at or near solar plant will be provided via information disclosure and
99 There will be a first aid kit and healthy and safety staff monitoring during the construction phase.
consultation activities, project information booklet (PIB) / frequently asked
questions (FAQ) flyers.
6.5.20 Physical Cultural Resources (PCRs)
315. There are no known PCRs within the solar plant site. During the construction stage,
there may be moderate temporary air quality impacts due to fugitive dust generation and
noise to these existing PCRs. These will be mitigated as per the steps detailed under Impacts
on Air Quality, Noise and Vibration and by conducting consultations to avoid sensitive religious
and spiritual functions/periods. In addition, site preparation and civil works during the
construction stage have the potential to disturb as yet unknown PCRs. A Chance Find
Procedures will be implemented as necessary. All activities will be supervised by SECU’s HS
officer, Social Officer, Environment Officer and monitored by the PMO of PRAC.
6.5.21 Interruption to Existing Utilities
316. To reduce impacts on existing utilities (such as power outages), solar plant
construction works and upgrade works will be scheduled in a phased manner. All activities will
be supervised by PRAC’s SECU (HS officer, Social Officer, Environment Officer).
317. Use of Existing Access Roads. Delivery of equipment, materials and machinery to work
sites at the solar plant may lead to increase in traffic and road congestion. It may cause
interference with road crossings during stringing of conductors. Movement of transport
vehicles will also result in moderate air quality impacts (dust and increase in vehicular
emissions) as well as an increase in noise (due to operation of transport vehicles) during peak
construction period (these are discussed under Impact on Air Quality, Noise and Vibration).
The potential impacts due to increase in traffic and road congestion will be mitigated through
the following measures as set out in the ESMP:
• Implement Traffic and Road Management Plan
• Follow planned transportation routes and delivery schedule
• Any traffic detours to have danger and clearly visible warning signs as well as
flag persons
• Compliance with local speed limits vehicle load carrying capacity and other
road regulations
• Any damage to roads to be borne by Contractor(s)
• Record of incidents/accidents/near-miss/fatalities/road damage will be
maintained
6.5.22 Other Risks
318. Forest fire in the dry season and flooding of the Praek Mkak during the wet season are
risks that need to be accounted for in the planning, design and management of the Project.
319. Management and Mitigation
• The project will construct a fire path break around the project boundary to
prevent forest fires from reaching the solar plant and other facilities.
• The project will maintain equipment ready for fire-fighting (e.g. water trucks
with water cannons) and train personnel to respond to forest fires in the
Project area.
• A flood-preventing dam is set up at the west of the project to stop rising water
148
149
level from flooding the solar plant.
• Implement and provide inductions to all staff on the Emergency Preparedness
and Response Procedures and measures described in the ESMP.
• Ongoing engagement with government authorities and consultation with local
communities will form part of a proactive approach to prevent or reduce risk
of natural hazards to project activities and communities.
6.6 Operation Stage
6.6.1 Workforce Organization And Orientation
320. The SECU (PMO) of PRAC will conduct briefing and orientation for all project staff,
workers, and its turnkey contractor/sub-contractors (facility operators):
• ESMP, GRM, Information disclosure and meaningful consultation,
environmental monitoring and reporting requirements
• Lender and Cambodia labor standards as documented in the human resource
management plan and local labor recruitment and training plans
• Responsibilities of the contractors in implementing SOPs and monitoring
environmental compliance with environmental performance indicators and
ESMP 100
• Responsibility of the contractors in engaging with affected persons for project
GRM
• Create awareness of communicable and sexually-transmitted diseases (i.e.
COVID-19, HIV/AIDs), child labor, bonded labor or forced labor
• Searching for an assessing, monitoring and recording keeping of carcass
searches (birds/bats)
• Record and maintain briefing and orientation events log with duration and list
of attendees
• Project Operation
6.6.2 Topography
321. The landscape changes associated with the development will be limited in duration
(life of project), with original landscape values restored at closure.
322. Maintaining and assuring the structural integrity of these project components is
critical to prevent health, safety and environmental impacts. Due to the topographical location
of the project and the surrounding forest cover, the changes to physical landscape in the
project development area will not be visible or have an impact beyond the project’s
immediate vicinity.
323. Operation stage impacts on land and vegetation are assessed for all infrastructure
types under project output 1 and discussed as follows.
324. Vegetation Management. Periodic vegetation maintenance will be undertaken at the
solar park site. The potential impacts during operation will be mitigated through the following
measures as set out in the ESMP:
100 PIC will develop checklists for use in monitoring environmental compliance during construction stage.
• Maintain landscaping along the fenced perimeter of the solar park
• Maintain hedges and trees at field margins
• Employ manual vegetation maintenance methods such as grazing by local
cattle or manual trimming of grasses and plants within the solar park site and
employ local labor
• Maintain the re-seeded site
• No chemicals (herbicides/pesticides) will be used
• To avoid buildups of trimmed vegetation and branches, these will be allowed
for collection by local people for firewood or facility operator will contact the
relevant local authorities for collection, transport and disposal.
6.6.3 Landscape Impact
325. The solar plant will create a visual impact and may result in induced access to the area.
The site is not surrounded by habitation or permanent structures. Steps to reduce visual
impacts e.g. maintenance of hedges and field margins around the fenced perimeter will be
incorporated after completion of civil works and during the start of operation. This project will
showcase green development of the power sector in Cambodia as well as preserve the local
biodiversity. Solar panel glare issues are not anticipated for solar PV plants101.
6.6.4 Air Quality, Noise and Vibration
326. Operation of the solar plant, substation, and solar PV plants will not impact the air
quality except for some fugitive dust generation due to movement of transport vehicles.
Monitoring of ambient air quality, noise and vibration will be undertaken annually.
6.6.5 Water Quality
327. Operation impacts on water quality and resources at the solar plant and associated
facilities may result due to excess usage, potential contamination to water sources due to
accidental spills and leakage as well as due to accidental discharge of wastewater. Contractors
within 60 days of each contract year after the commercial operation date, will be required to
provide to the PMO reasonable estimates of water usage for purposes of operating and
maintaining the solar PV plant for the applicable contract year.
328. The potential impacts on water quality and resources will be mitigated by the following
measures as set out in the ESMP.
• Through internal drainage system, stormwater will be collected and drainged into
retention ponds
• Maintain storm water retention pond for use for PV cleaning
• Periodic cleaning of storm water retention pond to remove debris
• No use of chemicals/detergents for cleaning purposes
• Provide and maintain permanent sanitary facilities to workers and safe drinking water
• Provide and maintain a septic system for wastewater collection and disposal; tank
system will be located at least 100 m from any water sources, to avoid contamination
• Maintain permanent secured (‘bunded’) areas on impermeable surfaces and dykes

151
capable of carrying 110% volume of materials for accidental spills or leakage
• Surface water monitoring will be undertaken annually.
6.6.6 Waste Generation
329. While it is not expected that solar PV panels at associated facilities within the solar
plant will require replacement since their life span is 25+ years; however some may fail due to
rain, humidity or heat. Inverters at the substation will likely be rebuilt as opposed to replaced.
Small amounts of domestic solid waste will also be generated at the solar plant site during
operation. Lack of proper handling, storage and disposal of domestic waste and/or broken PV
panels may result in adverse impacts. The potential impacts due to waste generation will be
mitigated by following the measures as set out in the ESMP:
• Compliance with Sub-decree No. 36 Solid Waste Management, MoE, 1999
• Utilize licensed vendors/suppliers for collection, transportation and disposal of
broken/unused PV panels
• Also store broken/redundant panels in covered bunded areas for each type of
disposal. The final disposal of redundant/broken solar panels will be sent to
recycling process depending on types of disposal
• Implement SOP for Materials Management and Waste Management
6.6.7 Ecological Impacts
330. The large area of PV panels in the solar plant may create a ‘lake effect’ which could
attract birds that mistake the solar panels for a water body and the hot panels could kill or
seriously injure birds, which attempt to land on them especially the young inexperienced ones.
There was a similar note from the bird and bat survey in 2019. This ESIA confirms that there
will be likely to be little concern over the bird crashes into solar panel since their population
has been declined due to the land use changes in the area. Their habitats have changed and,
therefore; not many birds are not returning back to site due to no food and habitat attractions.
To reduce or avoid bird crashing, PRAC shall install wind-driven bird deterrents (scarers) to
keep birds away from the solar panels. Or audible bird deterrents can be used to generate
frequencies that could distract the birds (Photo 18). While there may be avifauna migration
from one habitat to another habitat over close distances, for instance, the migration of egret
and heron species from the natural stream within the solar plant to the downstream reservoir,
such coverage is not anticipated for ground mammals or reptiles due to existing habitat
fragmentation and sustained human activity. PRAC will conduct the annual monitorings to
flora, fauna and fishery resources remaining in on site.

6.6.8 Occupational Health and Safety
331. Contractors will comply with the relevant safety measures required by law and as per
International Best Practices. The potential impacts to workers will be mitigated through the
following measures as set out in the ESMP:
• Implement SOP for Occupational Health and Safety
• Compliance to Cambodia Occupational Safety and Health laws and regulations,
MLVT, 2011
• Compliance to relevant national electrical safety standards
• Provide and maintain signage as per Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers standards at dangerous places for warning of electrical hazards
• Provide and maintain health assessment by a competent medical practitioner
for all workers
• Provide periodic training to all workers with access to electrical and hazardous
conditions and workers will be certified to work on site
• Provide and maintain workers appropriate PPE
• Equipment and tools will be inspected before use to ensure proper and safe
operation
• For infectious disease, there will be training to all workers for self-prevention,
clean living, and regularly (once per day) fogging activities at the temporary
workers camp for mosquito control.
• Appropriate grounding and deactivation of live power equipment during
maintenance work or if working in close proximity to the equipment; provision
of lightning arrestors as appropriate
• Record of health assessments, incidents, accidents, near-miss, fatalities will be
maintained
• EMF levels expected to be below the limits set by International Commission on
Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection which is 4.17 kV/m for electric field and 833
miliGauss for magnetic field; periodic EMF monitoring using hand held devices
as required
6.6.9 Community Health and Safety
332. The presence of a solar plant and its operation may pose potential hazards such as
electrocution, lighting strike due to accidental failure of power transmission and exposure to
EMF. Information and consultation with local residents (community awareness program) and
authorities will be conducted intermittently during operation stage. These activities will be
conducted in and around the villages situated close to the solar plant site.
333. The potential impacts will be mitigated by the following measures as set out in the
ESMP:
• Distribute PIB/FAQ and make it publicly available during consultations
• Communicate with communities on potential health and safety risks and
mitigation measures including ERPs
• Record of consultations will be maintained in accordance with Stakeholder
Analysis and Communication Plan
• Record of incidents, accidents, near-miss, fatalities associated with the project
will be maintained
152
153
• Records of issues raised will be maintained in accordance with project GRM
• Monitoring to this concern will be conducted annually.
6.7 Decommissioning Phase
334. The solar plant facility lifespan is expected to be >20 years, at which point it might be
decommissioned. Typical activities during the decommissioning and site reclamation phase
include facility removal, breaking up of concrete pads and foundations, removal of access
roads that are not maintained for other uses, re-contouring the surface (if required), and land
re-vegetation and replantation of trees. Associated impacts include erosion, noise, dust and
vehicle exhaust, and the need to properly manage large amounts of debris, solar panels, wire
and cabling, electronics, etc. solar plant and its power production may have a much longer
lifespan that the solar PV plants (order of 45 to 60 years), which may be further extended
through maintenance and periodic equipment replacement.
335. The ESMP plan provides a preliminary assessment of potential mitigation
measures/safeguards that may be implemented at a minimum of six months prior to plant
closure at that time. This will be followed by a detailed decommissioning and site reclamation
plan to be developed at that time. The preliminary assessment will include measures for
avoiding and/or minimizing surface erosion, impact to air and water quality, noise and
vibration, flow alteration, waste generation, impact to flora and fauna, traffic related issues as
well as health and safety of workers and communities.
6.8 Cumulative and Induced Impacts
336. In 2016, ADB conducted a preliminary grid-integration study on solar PV prospects for
Cambodia.103 The study report, issued in February 2017, demonstrates the technical feasibility
of rapid uptake of solar power to boost generation capacity, diversify the country’s energy mix,
increase energy security, improve system stability and avoid GHGs. The grid integration study
lays out three scenarios of PV penetration (low, medium and high), the corresponding levels
of electricity generation and emissions as well as impacts on the grid and recommended
mitigation measures. The study suggests that with currently available technologies, up to 150
MW of solar can be added to the grid by 2020 with no major impact on the grid and no
additional transmission investment.104 The study also suggests a staged solar PV capacity
development plan to 2030 that would allow new systems to be added as demand grows and
transmission capacity expands in Cambodia.
337. Given the above scenario, cumulative impacts could arise from other similar solar PV
projects in the vicinity that are being constructed concurrently with the construction stage of
this project. There are no existing commercial solar PV plants in operation in close proximity
to the proposed project except the 60 MW Solar Plant developed by Schnetic in Taing Krasaing
Commune, Toeuk Phos District and is about 40km to the proposed solar park in Kbal Toeuk
commune. The 10 MW Bavet solar park project in Svay Rieng province is approximately 200
km from the proposed site. Given the constraints in availability of information, it is only

possible to qualitatively assess cumulative impacts.
338. Topography and land-use: Field visits suggest that 500 ha in and around the solar plant
site are heavily disturbed by human activities; impacts resulting from land use change and
future solar PV plants at the site are expected to be medium. However, all solar PV power
plants will have negative impact on land use.
339. Soils, Surface and Groundwater: When preparing sites for PV panels, some developers
clear the entire site of vegetation, often leveling and grading the whole extent of the site. This
may result in soil compaction, soil disturbance and erosion and increase the sedimentation of
canals and/or any water bodies in the area. As solar PV plants occupy large areas, potential
cumulative impacts could be significant if not managed properly especially if more solar PV
plants were to be constructed and operated in the future in the surrounding wider area.
During operation, PV panels require water for panel cleaning. Some facility operators may
undertake groundwater extraction that may affect the groundwater table, excess usage and
shortage in water availability for other users in the area. With stipulated mitigation measures
to avoid disturbance to the soils as well as surface and groundwater usage, the cumulative
impacts associated with future solar PV plants in this regard are expected to be minor.
340. Air, Noise and Vibration: Most solar PV plants will have negative impacts on air, noise
and vibration during peak construction stage, which are temporary and localized in nature,
the cumulative impacts in this regard are expected to be minor. There will be no air quality
issues during operation except for fugitive dust emissions arising from movement of transport
vehicles on access roads. There will be some noise generation due to movement of vehicles
and operation of substation. However, cumulative impacts during operation in this regard are
expected to be minor.
341. Ecology: The biodiversity assessment confirmed that the proposed site does not
support any species or habitat of conservation value. However, given the considerable space
requirements of commercially viable solar PV plants (100 ha) and corresponding
site/vegetation clearances, the effect on ecology could be significant and should be informed
by detailed ecological assessment of the area under consideration.
342. Human Environment: Resettlement and rehabilitation of affected persons may have
higher relevance for solar PV plants in cases of land acquisition of paddy fields (that also serve
as a livelihood source for most rural communities) and associated power evacuation. However,
with implementation of safeguard measures such as careful site selection that avoids
agriculturally productive lands and appropriate and timely compensation, the cumulative
impacts associated with solar PV plants in this regard are expected to be minor.
343. Waste: All solar PV plant development will need to effectively manage their wastes
such as biodegradable waste (vegetation clearances), construction debris, presence of
workers and hazardous materials, leaks and spills. In case solar PV plants utilize lithium ion
batteries for energy storage, then certified vendors will need to be identified for collection
and disposal of batteries at the end of its life span. The cumulative impacts associated with
solar PV plants in this regard are expected to be minor if managed effectively.
154
155
344. Visual and Aesthetics: Within the wider surrounding area, there are no sensitive
human receptors, no sites of particular importance, visual or scenic features, environmental
reserves or parks that will be affected by the current or future development. The nearest
community forest is approximately 5-7 km away. Another issue is the potential for glare
caused by sunlight reflected off the PV panels from the future developments in the wider
project area. PV panels work on the concept of absorbing sunlight rather than reflecting it.
While minimal reflections from the panels are inevitable, this is not anticipated as a major
issue. Thus, impacts in this regard are expected to be minor.
345. Induced impacts would include more frequent use of major roads and access roads for
the transportation of workers, equipment and machinery to the solar plant site. This will result
in traffic nuisance to nearby communes and increase in dust due to movement of vehicles and
increase in vehicular emissions affecting air quality. However, with mitigation measures, the
impacts are expected to be minor.
CHAPTER 7: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
346. The 60MW Solar Plant's Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) identifies
the potential project environmental impacts and defines mitigation measures and monitoring
requirements for the design and pre-construction, construction, and operation stages of the
project. It also defines the institutional arrangements, roles and responsibilities of institutions
involved and cost estimates for implementation of the ESMP. The ESMP will ensure
environmental protection activities during all stages in order to prevent, reduce, or mitigate
adverse environmental impacts and risks. The ESMP draws on the findings of the project ESIA
report and discussions and agreements with ADB, IFC and EDC.
347. The 60MW solar plant’s ESMP is based on inputs from the Feasibility Study team for
the project as of June–July 2018, and field assessment in Sept-Nov 2020. Detailed engineering
designs are referred to in this ESMP. With the oversights of PIC and EPC of EDC’s National Solar
Park, PRAC’s SECU will inform the obligation of its Turnkey contractors/subcontractor to
implement the ESMP (Figure 22 below).

7.2 Reporting and Monitoring
351. The SECU will be responsible for environmental reporting and ensure compliance
checks and environmental monitoring. SECU will prepare the project Quarterly Progress
Reports (QPR) of 60MW solar plant for submission to NSP EDC’s PIC and six-month to the MoE,
and one monitoring report during construction and annual reports during operation till the
project completion for ADB/IFC. Together with NSP, the environmental monitoring reports of
60MW solar plant will be publicly disclosed on the ADB/IFC website. Reporting to ADB/IFC will
continue until project completion report is prepared, one year after physical completion.
352. The SECU of PRAC will be responsible for environmental monitoring specifically the
60MW solar plant. Three types of project monitoring will be conducted under the 60MW
ESMP.
§ Project readiness monitoring. To be conducted by the SECU
§ Environmental monitoring. To be conducted across all stages of project
implementation as described in the EMP and assessing compliance with applicable
Cambodia environmental quality standards
§ Compliance monitoring. To be conducted by the EDC NSP PIC to verify ESMP and EMOP
compliance during project implementation
353. ADB/IFC will oversee project compliance on the basis of the annual environmental
monitoring reports provided by SECU/PMO and site visits (generally one to two times per
year).
7.3 Training and Capacity Building
354. PRAC will engage suitably qualified and experienced employees and contractors
possessing relevant qualifications, certifications and/or licenses to ensure project duties and
requirements are carried out properly. External specialists who are suitably qualified to
support site employees will be engaged where there is a need for additional expertise. PRAC
will ensure that these consultants are suitably qualified and experienced for the Project.
355. In line with local regulatory requirements and labour laws, PRAC will employ
Cambodian nationals to the extent possible. Locally available management and technically
skilled personnel will be given preferential employment opportunities. There will be
international professionals employed who will be expected to train and mentor local
professionals in the long- term.
356. SECU of PRAC will provide orientation to contractors/sub-contract staff and hired
workers. Such training will be conducted prior to mobilization on site during construction and
operation stages. All parties involved in constructing and operating 60MW solar plant of PRAC
must have an understanding of the goals, methods, and practices of project environmental
management.

7.4 Cost Estimates
357. There are mitigation measures and corresponding costs:
§ Measures that will permanently become part of the infrastructure such as re-seeding
of sites, hedge planting, maintenance of field margins, perimeter fencing with
adequate ground clearance for passage of wild species/animals, road signage, detailed
engineering measures for preventing soil erosion and localized flooding (storm water
retention pond, strengthening of drainage canals), will be included within the main
civil work contract costs.
§ Measures during the construction stage (e.g. dust suppression by watering, quiet/low
noise machinery and equipment, PPE, etc.) as well as measures to mitigate unforeseen
impacts due to construction activities will need to be included in the tender
documents to ensure that all contractors budget these items in their bids.
§ Contractors will also bear all environmental monitoring costs during the operational
stage.
7.5 Project Reporting
358. PRAC will undertake the following environmental and social reporting for the Project
in accordance not only with the Cambodian Sub-decree on Environmental Impact Assessment
Process (1999), but also its lenders' reporting requirements:
§ Bi-monthly monitoring report during peak construction period, and annual monitoring
report to during operation period to Lenders
§ Quarterly monitoring report during construction period and annual monitoring report
during the operation period to NSP EDC's PIC
§ Six-month and annual monitoring reports to be submitted to Ministry of Environment
359. Significant findings from the environmental and social monitoring programs and
reportable incidents and complaints logged by the incident reporting system will need to be
reported and discussed at regular (e.g. weekly and monthly) management meetings as
necessary.
7.6 Summary of 60MW solar plant’s Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring
Measures
360. Mitigation measures are proposed for the PRAC in attempt to achieve the highest

§ Provide healthcare services for project employees with an
appropriately staffed site clinic |
| Operation Stage |  |
| Physical Resources |  |
| Topography | § Maintain landscaping along the fenced perimeter of the solar park
§ Maintain hedges and trees at field margins
§ Employ manual vegetation maintenance methods such as grazing
by local cattle or manual trimming of grasses and plants within the
solar park site and employ local labor
§ Maintain the re-seeded site
§ No chemicals (herbicides/pesticides) will be used |
| Water Quality | § Through internal drainage system, stormwater will be collected
and drained into retention ponds
§ Maintain storm water retention pond for use for PV cleaning
§ Periodic cleaning of storm water retention pond to remove debris
§ No use of chemicals/detergents for cleaning purposes
§ Provide and maintain permanent sanitary facilities to workers and
safe drinking water
§ Provide and maintain a septic system for wastewater collection
and disposal; tank system will be located at least 100 m from any
water sources, to avoid contamination
§ Maintain permanent secured (‘bunded’) areas on impermeable
surfaces and dykes capable of carrying 110% volume of materials
for accidental spills or leakage |
| Waste Generation | § Compliance with Sub-decree No. 36 Solid Waste Management,
MoE 1999
§ Utilize licensed vendors/suppliers for collection, transportation
and disposal of broken/unused PV panels
§ Also store broken/redundant panels in covered bunded areas for
each type of disposal. The final disposal of redundant/broken solar
panels will be sent to recycling process depending on types of
disposal
§ Implement SOP for Materials Management and Waste
Management |
| Biological Resources |  |
| Biological Impacts | § To reduce or avoid bird crashing, PRAC shall install wind-driven bird
deterrents (scarers) to keep birds away from the solar panels. Or
audible bird deterrents can be used to blast out over 50 random
frequencies that could annoy the birds. |
| Occupational
Health and Safety | § Provide and maintain signage as per Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers standards at dangerous places for warning of
electrical hazards
§ Provide and maintain health assessment by a competent medical
practitioner for all workers |

Environnemental Key Mitigation Measures
& Social Quality
§ Provide periodic training to all workers with access to electrical and
hazardous conditions and workers will be certified to work on site
§ Provide and maintain workers appropriate PPE
§ Equipment and tools will be inspected before use to ensure proper
and safe operation
§ For infectious disease, there will be training to all workers for self-
preventation, and regularly (one for day) spray mosquito smoke
around camp site.
§ Appropriate grounding and deactivation of live power equipment
during maintenance work or if working in close proximity to the
equipment; provision of lightning arrestors as appropriate
§ Record of health assessments, incidents, accidents, near-miss,
fatalities will be maintained
Community § Communicate with communities on potential health and safety
Health and Safety risks and mitigation measures including ERPs
§ Record of consultations will be maintained in accordance with
Stakeholder Analysis and Communication Plan
§ Record of incidents, accidents, near-miss, fatalities associated with
the project will be maintained
Decommissioning § The ESMP plan provides a preliminary assessment of potential
Phase mitigation measures/safeguards that may be implemented at a
minimum of six months prior to plant closure at that time. This will
be followed by a detailed decommissioning and site reclamation
plan to be developed at that time. The preliminary assessment will
include measures for avoiding and/or minimizing surface erosion,
impact to air and water quality, noise and vibration, flow
alteration, waste generation, impact to flora and fauna, traffic
related issues as well as health and safety of workers and
communities.
361. Also, Table 41 below summarizes the key environmental and social monitoring
measures to be implemented for each phase of the project. Further details of the proposed
monitoring program are provided in the ESMP.

7.7 Environmental and Social Fund
362. As required by Cambodian regulation, PRAC will contribute toward the following fund
• Environmental Fund = $500 per year
• Social Fund = $500 per year
363. The toal fund from the project for the next 20 years is $20,000.

CHAPTER 8: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
364. This ESIA has been prepared as per the requirements of ADB Safeguard Policy
Statement 2009 and IFC Performance Standards 2012. This ESIA is also in line with the
Cambodian Sub-decree No.72 on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) issued on 11 August
1999.
365. This project is expected to have significant environmental benefits. A transition to
clean energy sources (i.e. solar energy generation) will limit import dependence on coal and
other fossil fuels, delay or defer construction of new coal-fired plants and reduce reliance on
hydropower generation. This would contribute to national emission reduction targets and
reduced pollution impacts.
366. The total land conversion for a 60 MW solar plant is 97 ha, of which is permanent.
Some vegetation on site will be maintained for safety reasons.
367. The potential adverse environment impacts associated with the project have been
avoided or minimized through careful site selection of the solar park (where the 60MW solar
plant is located). A biodiversity assessment conducted for the project confirms that there are
no habitats or species of conservation value in the project area of influence.
368. While climate change impacts are not anticipated to be significant over the design life
of the 60 solar plant (+20 years), the preliminary design integrates flood resilience measures
such as elevating 60 MW solar plant, strengthening existing drainage canals and building a
storm water retention pond. Regular maintenance of drainage canals, storm water retention
pond and access roads will be carried out to ensure their ongoing effective operation. The key
climate vulnerable components will be subject to further analysis during the detailed
engineering design.
369. The Project is not expected to cause significant adverse impacts, the identified impacts
can be managed through effective implementation of the mitigation measures specified in the
ESMP. Monitoring parameters have been identified to check the effectiveness of ESMP
measures and to ensure any unidentified impacts can be readily addressed.
370. The SECU/PMO of PRAC will set up a GRM and GRC as soon as the project commences
to deal with environmental and social issues that may be raised by affected persons and other
relevant stakeholders during project implementation. The GRM will be coordinated by the
SECU/PMO. GRM will address concerns and complaints promptly via transparent process.
371. Public consultations and FGDs with project affected persons and other relevant
stakeholders were conducted in May and July 2018. Measures to address concerns raised
during the consultations have been integrated in the design and ESMP. Overall, all
stakeholders were made aware of the proposed project and were supportive due to expected
benefits such as local employment. Consultations with project-affected stakeholders will
continue during detailed design and project implementation.
372. The Project has been designed to minimize impacts and risk on key environmental
values and social values, particularly the Praek Mkak. The Project will result in a short-term
and spatially confined impact on the project site. Habitat (and flora) loss for project
development is necessary and cannot be avoided. However, the loss will be partially restored
by rehabilitation.
373. The project will provide a significant benefit to the Kampong Chhnang and Kampong
Speu provinces and Cambodian economy. The project will be the largest investment in the
province, and the flow on effect to the economy of this province is likely to be considerable.
Revenues from taxes, royalties and investment will make a substantive contribution to the
development of the Cambodian economy. With careful implementation of the proposed
management, mitigation and offset/compensation measures, the project should bring a net
socio-economic benefit to Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu provinces and Cambodia
without compromising the integrity of the hydrology, and other socio-economic resources.
374. It is recommended that PRAC:
§ Strictly implement the ESMP, Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan and
approved mitigations and monitoring measures in this ESIA at all phases of the project
development.
§ Cooperate with the Ministry of Environment, line ministries and local authorities to
ensure that the mitigation/monitoring measures are enforced and are participatory.
§ Establish the Environmental and Social Fund to contribute to the further and wider
conservation, restoration and management of the social and environmental resources
around the project site and in Cambodia.
§ Commit to the environmental contract and other agreements prescribed by the
Ministry of Environment.
375. Based on the results of the ESIA, public consultation, and the commitment of the
project proponent, associated losses and impacts from the project can be managed, mitigated
and monitored to prevent, reduce and avoid the majority of impacts at all phases of the
project development. It is clear that the project has the full capacity and resources to protect
the environmental and social assets associated with implementation of the project. In
addition, there will be economic benefits and a lasting positive legacy from the project.

I. THE PROPOSAL
1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of
up to $8,100,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $4,800,000; and (ii) a B loan of up to $3,300,000
to Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited (the borrower) for the Prime Road
National Solar Park Project in Cambodia. The report also describes the proposed administration
of a loan of up to $4,200,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector
in Asia II (CFPS II)1 for the Prime Road National Solar Park Project, and if the Board approves
the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the
administration of the CFPS II loan.
2. The limited recourse project finance loan will support the borrower in developing and
operating a 60-megawatt alternating current (MWac) solar photovoltaic power plant in Kampong
Chhnang Province, in Cambodia (the project). The project is the culmination of a One Asian
Development Bank (ADB) effort over several years to develop a solar park in Cambodia involving
the Southeast Asia Department (SERD), the Sustainable Development and Climate Change
Department, the Office of Public–Private Partnership, and the Private Sector Operations
Department (PSOD). Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited was awarded the
project through a competitive reverse auction tender process that resulted in the lowest utility-
scale solar tariff in Southeast Asia at the time: $0.03877 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The ADB loan
will meet the borrower’s requirements for longer-tenor, United States dollar-denominated project
financing, which local financial institutions are unable to provide. ADB has led the transaction and
will mobilize more than $5 of cofinancing from commercial, development finance, and
concessional sources for every $1 of ADB investment. CFPS II concessional financing helped
contribute to a financially viable bid result with a competitive tariff. The project will contribute to
ADB’s climate change mitigation efforts by reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions in the
energy sector by 110,700 tons per year. Classified effective gender mainstreaming, the project
will also promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in Cambodia.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Identification and Description
1. Project Identification
3. Since the early 1990s, Cambodia has enacted wide-ranging reforms and transformed itself
from a country beset by 3 decades of civil conflict and instability to a high-growth, market-oriented
economy. Its economic growth reached an average rate of 6.4% from 2009 to 2019,2 and the
poverty rate fell substantially from 30.1% in 2009 to 12.9% in 2018.3 The household electrification
rate also increased significantly from 19% in 2009 to 75% in 2019.4
4. Total electricity demand grew from 2,077 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2009 to 12,015 GWh
in 2019, and is expected to reach 24,184 GWh by 2025 under a medium-growth scenario that
ADB helped prepare for Cambodia’s Power Development Master Plan (2020–2040).5 While the

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic will likely lead to a deceleration of this growth
trajectory, pre-crisis growth patterns are expected to reemerge in tandem with an eventual
economic recovery.
5. Cambodia’s power supply still depends heavily on hydropower, coal, diesel, and imports
from neighboring countries. Its installed capacity totaled 2,756 megawatts (MW) at the end of
2019, of which hydropower accounted for the largest share (48%), followed by coal (24%).
Cambodia relies on a further 627 MW of cross-border capacity from the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam. However, solar is a promising renewable energy source in
Cambodia, potentially complementing hydropower resources and reducing reliance on coal and
diesel generation. The country enjoys some of the highest solar resources in the Greater Mekong
Subregion, with solar irradiance measuring on average 1,400 kWh–1,800 kWh per square meter
per year throughout the country, for an estimated technical potential of more than 8,000 MW.6
6. In June 2016, the Government of Cambodia received approval from the multidonor climate
investment funds for an investment plan under the Scaling-Up Renewable Energy for Low-Income
Countries Program. The program investment plan in Cambodia included $21.3 million to
accelerate solar power through both the public and private sectors.7 In 2016, ADB also approved
a loan to support the first utility-scale solar project in Cambodia, the Bavet solar project.8 The
success and experience with this project helped Electricité du Cambodge (EDC), the national
utility, get more comfortable with intermittent solar resources.
7. In 2017, at the government’s request, SERD developed a preliminary national solar
photovoltaic grid integration study and road map for EDC. Following this study, SERD presented
the idea of a large-scale solar park to EDC, to promote solar at scale and help EDC gain
experience in procuring power from the private sector through transparent and competitive
processes, using standardized legal and commercial agreements. In 2019, ADB approved the
Cambodia National Solar Park Project, which will be able to accommodate at least 100 MWac of
solar photovoltaic capacity and consists of 150–200 hectares (ha) of land, fencing, drainage,
roads, and plant buildings, a substation, and a transmission line.9 The solar park will also host the
first utility-scale pilot battery energy storage installation in Cambodia with up to 16 megawatt-
hours of capacity.10 Transaction advisory services provided by ADB’s Office of Public–Private
Partnership to EDC helped prepare and conduct a competitive reverse auction11 tender to procure
the first 60 MWac of power from the solar park which has culminated in this project. The remaining
40 MWac of capacity in the solar park will be tendered in a second phase.12

2. Project Design
9. The project is in Kampong Chhnang Province 70 kilometers from the capital, Phnom Penh,
one of the main electricity demand centers in Cambodia responsible for about 70% of the national
electricity demand. To provide 60 MWac of power to the grid, the borrower will install 78 MW of

direct current solar photovoltaic capacity using innovative bifacial13 modules and a single-axis
tracking mounting system, features that help increase energy generation and decrease the cost
per kWh.
10. The project represents phase 1 of the planned 100 MWac Cambodian National Solar Park
Project (footnote 9 and footnote 12), the first large-scale solar park in Southeast Asia and an
important One ADB initiative. The sponsor won the project through a competitive international
bidding process among 26 short-listed participants. PSOD supported 20 of the bidders with a
letter of support and indicative term sheet. The project achieved the then lowest utility-scale solar
tariff in Southeast Asia of $0.03877 per kWh. This will help lower the electricity price in Cambodia,
which is among the highest in the region.14 The project company has entered into a 20-year power
purchase agreement (PPA) with EDC, the state-owned utility, to supply 60 MWac of power to the
designated EDC substation inside the solar park. EDC will provide the project land. EDC is also
building a dedicated transmission line for the solar park with ADB sovereign assistance.
11. Cambodia has policies on both renewable energy and gender equality, but these are not
integrated or mutually conducive. In energy-related public sector operations, men still tend to
dominate the technical and managerial roles, while women are typically hired into finance and
accounting functions. This is particularly true across the lower Mekong region.15 The low literacy
and education levels of women in the workforce, combined with attitudes toward gender roles that
emphasize women as “lower status” and “household managers,” limit their livelihood alternatives
or opportunities for higher-level occupations and decision-making positions.16
3. The Borrower and Sponsor
12. The borrower is Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited, a special-purpose
vehicle incorporated in Cambodia to implement the project. It will be about 100%17 owned by
Prime Road Alternative Company Limited (Prime Road Alternative, the sponsor), a pioneering
solar energy system developer in Thailand and a part of the Prime Road Group.
13. Prime Road Group is an investment group based in Thailand with diversified interests in
renewable energy, real estate, and waste management, and a regional focus in Asia and the
Pacific. The group is a new client for ADB. Prime Road Power Public Company Limited is the
investment holding company for the group’s renewable energy business (holding 100% interest in
the sponsor) with a market capitalization of B8.0 billion as of 3 November 2020. CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION DELETED. The group has a 7-year track record in the development, construction,
and operations of solar power plants; its total portfolio of 286 MW consists of 22 projects in
operation with an installed capacity of 178 MW, and four projects under development and
construction with an aggregate capacity of 108 MW.

16. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts. While Cambodia reported relatively few
COVID-19 cases, the virus-induced global economic slowdown will affect its three most important
industries—construction, tourism, and apparel exports—which account for more than 70% of
economic growth and almost 40% of total employment.18 ADB estimates that Cambodia’s
economic growth will be negative in 2020, before returning to a positive growth rate of nearly 6%
in 2021.19 Reports suggest that COVID-19 has affected power demand in the first half of 2020.20
However, it has not had any material impact on the project’s progress.
B. Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs
17. Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) exploration and development
of environmentally and socially acceptable energy resources needed to supply all sectors of
Cambodia's economy encouraged, and (ii) renewable energy to reduce Cambodia’s greenhouse
gas emissions promoted.
18. Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: energy generated from renewable
sources increased.
19. Outputs. The project has four outputs: (i) a new solar power plant constructed, (ii) local
employment with enhanced gender equality generated, (iii) gender equality of employment
strengthened, and (iv) gender equality in the community increased.
C. Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations
20. Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with
ADB’s Strategy 2030, which outlines seven operational priorities to tackle the development
challenges in Asia and the Pacific.21 The project supports three of them: (i) tackling climate
change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (ii)
addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; and (iii) accelerating progress in gender
equality. It also supports Strategy 2030’s objectives to expand the role of private sector
operations, mobilize additional resources on top of ADB’s own financing, and deliver $80 billion
of cumulative climate financing by 2030. The project is aligned with ADB’s country partnership
strategy, 2019–2023 for Cambodia, which calls for continued ADB investment into renewable
energy in support of sustainable and inclusive growth.22
21. Consistency with sector strategy. The project aligns with ADB’s Energy Policy, which
supports wider access to energy through investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy
projects.23 Consistent with the One ADB approach, the project benefitted from close coordination
with ADB’s SERD in assessing and analyzing Cambodia’s energy sector.

B. Value Added by ADB Assistance
28. Because of concerns about political risk and the nascent state of the local banking sector,
obtaining long-term financing necessary for infrastructure investments remains a challenge in
Cambodia. ADB’s lead role in the transaction helps to mobilize a comprehensive long-term
financing package for a landmark renewable energy project in the region. Its early engagement
in the project and its ability to catalyze long-term loans from a variety of sources, including a
commercial bank, gave bidders more confidence that debt finance would be available, thereby
contributing to lower tariff bids.
29. ADB’s strong support at all stages of the project will demonstrate the benefits of
transparent and competitive bidding, long-term financing, and clean energy at scale. It also
highlights the potential to develop Cambodia’s power supply through low-cost public–private
partnership arrangements from domestic renewable energy sources, providing an alternative to
coal-fired generation. A successful implementation will show that solar power infrastructure
projects can be developed in a transparent manner, while achieving very competitive tariffs at
levels well below grid parity even in frontier markets that are perceived as more challenging.
ADB’s involvement also helped enhance the project’s environmental and social management
practices, including stronger gender benefits.
C. Risks
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.
IV. POLICY COMPLIANCE
A. Safeguards and Social Dimensions
30. In compliance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified
category B for environment, category C for involuntary resettlement, and category C for
indigenous peoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been
identified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse
impacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans.
31. An independent consultant prepared an initial environmental and social examination
report for the project. No protected areas or particularly sensitive environmental receptors were
identified within or adjacent to the project site. The potential environmental impacts (e.g., noise,
vibration, dust, waste generation, ground contamination, and soil erosion) are generally
associated with construction activities. These impacts are considered to be site-specific and short-
term, and can be effectively managed by implementing good engineering, construction, and
project management practices as well as preventive and control measures reflected in the World
Bank Group’s Environmental, Health, and Safety General Guidelines, and detailed in the site-
specific environmental management plans. Occupational health and safety risks will be mitigated
through the development of a health and safety plan that will include routine training, monitoring,
and the provision of personal protective equipment. Environmental and occupational health and
safety provisions, consistent with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement, will be
incorporated into the contractor agreements.
7
32. The project does not require involuntary resettlement, and no distinct and vulnerable
indigenous people groups were identified in the area. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
DELETED.
33. The borrower will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB’s Social Protection
Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor
standards. The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors’) compliance
with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. The borrower will annually submit a safeguards and
social monitoring report that will include information on the project’s compliance with the
Safeguard Policy Statement. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will
follow ADB requirements.25
34. Effective gender mainstreaming. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.
Following ADB’s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), the borrower has incorporated
measures to promote gender equality and/or women’s empowerment in its business activities.
Key features of the gender action plan include (i) increasing gender inclusiveness in its
procurement, (ii) taking on female interns in technical roles, (iii) implementing an anti-sexual
harassment policy, and (iv) delivering a community project that caters to women’s needs. The
borrower will submit periodic reports on the implementation of gender measures to ADB.
35. Climate change impact. The project will supply Cambodia’s electricity grid with solar
power and help reduce 110,700 tons of carbon dioxideper annum by 2023.
B. Anticorruption Policy
36. Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited was advised of ADB’s policy of
implementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and
the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate
provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for
ADB in the event of noncompliance.
C. Investment Limitations
37. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.
D. Assurances
38. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),26
ADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of
Cambodia has no objection to the proposed assistance to Prime Road Alternative (Cambodia)
Company Limited. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance

GENDER ACTION PLAN
A. Gender Context
1. Gender relations. In Cambodia, women exercise considerable autonomy and
independence. They can own assets, manage financial transactions, and contribute to household
decision making. Both men and women can inherit property, and the gender division of labor can
be complementary and flexible, with men and women performing a range of productive and
household tasks. In practice, however, traditional norms and low levels of education and literacy
still limit girls’ and women’s choices and options. Cambodia remains a hierarchical society with
strong ideas about power and status. Women are considered to be of lower status than men,
although status is also determined by age and other socioeconomic characteristics, especially
wealth. For women, marriage and children additionally determine status. In general, attitudes
toward gender roles still emphasize the woman as household manager and the man as provider.
Women are also severely underrepresented in decision-making processes outside the household.
Gender disparities in employment remain extensive, primarily because of traditional attitudes
about “appropriate” occupations for women and men. The low literacy and education levels of
women in the workforce greatly limit their livelihood alternatives and bar them from higher level
occupations and decision-making positions.1
2. Renewable energy sector. The policy environment on both renewable energy and
gender equality is in place in Cambodia, however they remain separate and siloed with men
dominating the renewable energy sector. Although women are being increasingly employed, men
still overwhelmingly occupy executive and management level positions with women usually
concentrated in the financial, administrative, human resources, and promotional aspects of
energy organizations. Perceptions that ‘energy work’ involves heavy labor and is not ‘suitable’ for
women persist. This is in large part due to the field-based aspects of installation and repair of
power grids that are commonly associated with masculine labor, and that traveling afar for this
purpose pose risks to women and pull them away from their families. A number of women are
leading renewable energy businesses (e.g., solar energy, biomass, and clean energy
cookstoves), although their opportunities for expansion are circumscribed by persistent gender
norms including domestic obligations and barriers to financing.2
3. Procurement. Globally, women-owned businesses earn less than 1% of the money spent
on products and services by large corporations and governments.3 A company which seeks to
increase its proportion of women-owned suppliers increases its ability to tap into local networks
and knowledge opening the door to more innovation, greater competitiveness, and possible cost
reductions.4

INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Country: Cambodia Project Title: Prime Road National Solar Park Project
Lending/Financing Loan Department/ Private Sector Operations Department
Modality: Division: Private Sector Infrastructure Division 2
I. POVERTY IMPACT AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS
A. Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy
The project comprises a loan to Prime road Alternative (Cambodia) Company Limited for the development,
construction and operation of a 60 MW alternating current (MWac) utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power project
in Kampong Chhnang Province. The Project will contribute to the establishment of the first phase of the planned 100
MWac Cambodian National Solar Park Project. The government will lease necessary land for the project, which was
purchased by the government through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) sovereign loan for the establishment of
the larger solar park. Cambodia aims to reduce poverty among its citizens through improved electricity supply and
coverage. Cambodia’s current policy framework for poverty reduction comprises the government’s socioeconomic
policy agenda, the Rectangular Strategy Phase IV (2018–2023) and its implementation plan, the National Strategic
Development Plan, 2019–2023. As stated in the strategy, the national poverty reduction target is greater than one
percentage point per year. In addition, two multi-sector strategies have poverty reduction at their core: the National
Social Protection Strategy for the Poor and Vulnerable and the National Food Security and Nutrition Strategy. The
project contributes to one of the four priority areas in the Rectangular Strategy Phase IV, namely, continued
investment in energy infrastructure.a As the first utility scale solar public–private partnership in Cambodia, the project
aims to expand low-cost energy infrastructure, while strengthening private sector participation in the energy sector.
The project is aligned with the ADB country partnership strategy for Cambodia 2019–2023, which aims to reduce
income poverty, multidimensional poverty, and poverty vulnerability, and to promote inclusive growth by focusing on
rural areas and rural–urban–regional linkages.b The project is also aligned with ADB’s Strategy 2030, which
promotes addressing remaining poverty in developing member countries, tackling climate change and enhancing
environmental sustainability, strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and catalyzing financial resources
for development. The project is also a significant opportunity to demonstrate a One ADB approach through ADB’s
provision of sovereign lending, transaction advisory and project finance.
B. Poverty Targeting:
General intervention Individual or household (TI-H) Geographic (TI-G) Non-income MDGs (TI-M1, M2,
etc.)
A reliable, affordable and sustainable supply of energy will improve the business environment in Cambodia and
encourage additional investment and economic growth. Cambodia’s Industrial Development Policy, 2015–2025
recognizes that current electricity tariffs and interrupted supply are major impediments to the competitiveness of the
country’s manufacturing sector and calls for alternate sources of energy to be developed. Such investment will
provide job opportunities, higher incomes, and improved living conditions for local Cambodians.c The project has
the lowest grid tied solar tariff at USC 3.877/kWh in Southeast Asia. This will help lower the electricity price in
Cambodia, which is among the highest in the region. In mid-2019, residential electricity price in Cambodia (US¢
15/kWh) is higher than in Thailand (US¢ 12/kWh), Indonesia (US¢ 10/kWh), Viet Nam (US¢ 8/kWh) and Bangladesh
(US¢ 6/kWh).d Using ADB’s sovereign financing, Electricitė du Cambodge (EDC) is constructing a solar park facility
to accommodate up to 100 MWac of solar PV power generation capacity situated 60-70 kilometers from Phnom
Penh, one of the main electricity demand centers in Cambodia. The Solar Park facility includes land, access road,
substation, and transmission lines to connect to the grid. EDC acquired the land which will be provided to the project
through a 20-year land lease agreement.
C. Poverty and Social Analysis
1. Key issues and potential beneficiaries. The project site and transmission line route selected by EDC were chosen
following an alternatives analysis to avoid impacts on residential and other structures, crops and trees. Power plant
land was formerly used for commercial cassava plantation and there are no villages within 5 kilometers. Direct
beneficiaries are therefore land sellers, village community members that may access employment opportunities and
EDC as off taker of electricity produced. Indirect beneficiaries include EDC customers and companies within the
borrower’s supply chain that will benefit from procurement of goods and services for the project. Community
members may be constrained in accessing proposed employment opportunity because the borrower outsources
construction, operation and maintenance to sub-contractors that will likely utilize in-house resources, expertise and
services to optimize associated costs. The solar park feasibility study impact assessment reported that in 2015 22%
of households in Kbal Tuek commune where the power plant will be located live below the national poverty line. The
assessment further notes that at the time, no households in Kbal Tuek commune were connected to the grid and
61% used batteries as the primary source of electricity.

2. Impact channels and expected systemic changes. The design, construction and operation of a solar plant provides
limited impact channels for the direct beneficiaries, except for employment opportunities on a renewable energy
project. More broadly, indirect beneficiaries such as EDC customers are expected to be able to access more
affordable and better electricity supply through the addition of the solar plant to the grid.
3. Focus of (and resources allocated in) the transaction TA or due diligence. The borrower will assess the
environmental and social impacts of its specific project design and submit the report to ADB for approval. Due
diligence will additionally include development of assurance from the borrower that all commitments made by EDC
to ADB as part of the earlier sovereign loan regarding plant site construction and operation are cascaded down and
accepted. For instance, the solar park feasibility study undertaken by EDC highlighted high poverty incidence among
households in the communes surrounding the power plant site and likely absence of skilled labor. EDC however
requires in the impact assessment that contractors use local labor for manual work and eligible local workforce for
technical and administrative jobs. The terms of reference for the borrower’s impact assessment therefore includes
scope for an updated assessment of poverty incidence and skills availability. The borrower indicated in its project
proposal that in addition to provision of employment opportunities, it plans to provide financial support for local
community development activities.
II. GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT
1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or
program? Cambodia has policies targeting renewable energy, as well as gender equality, however they are not well
integrated. Public-sector energy roles in Cambodia still tend to be male-dominated, with women in the sector typically
employed in finance and accounting departments. This is typical across the lower Mekong region, where women
are being increasingly employed in public-sector energy organizations, though men still overwhelmingly occupy
executive and management level positions.e The low literacy and education levels of women in the workforce,
combined with attitudes toward gender roles that emphasize the women as “lower status” and “household manager”
still limit women’s livelihood alternatives and opportunities for higher level occupations and decision-making
positions.f
2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to contribute to the promotion of gender equity and/or
empowerment of women by providing women’s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets,
and participation in decision making? Yes No
The project comprises a loan to a Thailand based solar development company for the construction and operation of
a 60 MWac plant in a rural area. The borrower will outsource all construction and operation phase work to sub-
contractors and is responsible only for the supply electricity to EDC. The project team will explore project related
opportunities with the borrower for gender mainstreaming actions within its corporate structure and in the community.
3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality?
Yes No
The project has not caused involuntarily displacement or livelihood impacts that would disproportionately adversely
affect women or girls.
4. Indicate the intended gender mainstreaming category:
GEN (gender equity) EGM (effective gender mainstreaming)
SGE (some gender elements) NGE (no gender elements)
III. PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT
1. Who are the main stakeholders of the project, including beneficiaries and negatively affected people? Identify
how they will participate in the project design. The main stakeholders for the government’s solar park project
(including the transmission line) were identified during the feasibility study and engaged during consultation
meetings in May 2018 for the impact assessment. The main stakeholders for the power plant site are households
in villages, village leaders and commune councils. Consultation included public meetings, provision of information
booklets in Khmer, and focus group discussions.
2. How can the project contribute (in a systemic way) to engaging and empowering stakeholders and beneficiaries,
particularly, the poor, vulnerable, and excluded groups? What issues in the project design require participation of
the poor and excluded? The solar park project feasibility study included extensive consultation with local government
officials and communities. The borrower will undertake further consultation with stakeholders as part of its impact
assessment and per the requirements of the solar park project stakeholder engagement strategy. The strategy
includes a grievance redress mechanism. Due diligence will include attaining borrower assurance of implementation
of the strategy.
3. What are the key, active, and relevant civil society organizations (CSOs) in the project area? What is the level of
civil society organization participation in the project design? While no specific groups are named in the stakeholder
analysis as part of the solar park feasibility study, the presence of community forest protection, religious and micro-
finance organizations are noted. The study further identified, though did not name, non-government environment
and natural resource conservation groups present in Kbal Teuk commune.

4. Are there issues during project design for which participation of the poor and excluded is important? What are
they and how should they be addressed? Yes No
Ongoing implementation of the stakeholder engagement strategy along with re-engagement with groups as part of
the borrower’s impact assessment, provides adequate opportunity for participation of the poor an excluded in the
project planning process. There are no specific issues that directly require the participation of these groups, however
attention will be paid during due diligence on household poverty incidence, access to electricity in households and
skills availability in the general project area.
IV. SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS
A. Involuntary Resettlement Category A B C FI
1. Does the project have the potential to involve involuntary land acquisition resulting in physical and economic
displacement? Yes No The project will be built and operated on EDC-owned land leased to ADB’s
borrower. At the time of bidding the borrower estimated that it would require approximately 75 hectares of a total 91
hectares that had been procured at that time.g EDC purchased the land on a willing-buyer willing-seller basis on
commercial terms at a rate mutually agreed by all parties. EDC commissioned an external independent expert (a
local law form) to undertake a review of the procurement process for the plant site, which determined that
negotiations were free, fair, transparent and did not cause involuntary displacement impacts. The plant site land
was formerly used by two owners for commercial cassava plantations. The plant will export power to the national
electricity grid through transmission facilities to be provided by EDC. The project will interconnect with a pooling
substation that will be built by EDC on EDC owned land immediately adjacent to the plant. Involuntary displacement
impacts have been anticipated by EDC in the construction of the dedicated 40-kilometer transmission line and a
resettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with ADB Safeguard Policy Statement requirements.
Implementation of the plan will be monitored by ADB’s sovereign operations department. ADB’s non-sovereign
borrower will undertake an environmental and social impact assessment to assess project impacts, however, no
additional involuntary displacement impacts are anticipated.
2. What action plan is required to address involuntary resettlement as part of the transaction TA or due diligence
process?
Resettlement plan Resettlement framework Social impact matrix
Environmental and social management system arrangement None
B. Indigenous Peoples Category A B C FI
1. Does the proposed project have the potential to directly or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood
systems, or culture of indigenous peoples? Yes No
2. Does it affect the territories or natural and cultural resources indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim, as
their ancestral domain? Yes No The impact assessment for the solar park project feasibility study
found no presence of distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples groups in the power plant project area.
3. Will the project require broad community support of affected indigenous communities? Yes No
4. What action plan is required to address risks to indigenous peoples as part of the transaction TA or due
diligence process?
Indigenous peoples plan Indigenous peoples planning framework Social impact matrix
Environmental and social management system arrangement None
V. OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES AND RISKS
1. What other social issues and risks should be considered in the project design?
Creating decent jobs and employment (L) Adhering to core labor standards Labor retrenchment
Spread of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS Increase in human trafficking Affordability
Increase in unplanned migration Increase in vulnerability to natural disasters Creating political

2. How are these additional social issues and risks going to be addressed in the project design? The project will
require only five skilled employees during operation (a site manager, a senior electrical engineer and three electrical
engineers). Module cleaning and vegetation control will be undertaken on a seasonal basis and in accordance with
weather patterns and ad-hoc events (accumulation of matter on surfaces such as soil or bird droppings). The project
presents only limited opportunities for local employment during the 18-month construction phase and during
operations. During due diligence the ADB team will work with the borrower to maximize the potential use of local
workers by contractors during construction and operation.
VI. TRANSACTION TA OR DUE DILIGENCE RESOURCE REQUIREMENT
1. Do the terms of reference for the transaction TA (or other due diligence) contain key information needed to be
gathered during transaction TA or due diligence process to better analyze (i) poverty and social impact, (ii) gender


--- Table on Page 6 ---
| 4. Are there issues during project design for which participation of the poor and excluded is important? What are
they and how should they be addressed? Yes No
Ongoing implementation of the stakeholder engagement strategy along with re-engagement with groups as part of
the borrower’s impact assessment, provides adequate opportunity for participation of the poor an excluded in the
project planning process. There are no specific issues that directly require the participation of these groups, however
attention will be paid during due diligence on household poverty incidence, access to electricity in households and
skills availability in the general project area. |

| IV. SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS |
| A. Involuntary Resettlement Category A B C FI |
| 1. Does the project have the potential to involve involuntary land acquisition resulting in physical and economic
displacement? Yes No The project will be built and operated on EDC-owned land leased to ADB’s
borrower. At the time of bidding the borrower estimated that it would require approximately 75 hectares of a total 91
hectares that had been procured at that time.g EDC purchased the land on a willing-buyer willing-seller basis on
commercial terms at a rate mutually agreed by all parties. EDC commissioned an external independent expert (a
local law form) to undertake a review of the procurement process for the plant site, which determined that
negotiations were free, fair, transparent and did not cause involuntary displacement impacts. The plant site land
was formerly used by two owners for commercial cassava plantations. The plant will export power to the national
electricity grid through transmission facilities to be provided by EDC. The project will interconnect with a pooling
substation that will be built by EDC on EDC owned land immediately adjacent to the plant. Involuntary displacement
impacts have been anticipated by EDC in the construction of the dedicated 40-kilometer transmission line and a
resettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with ADB Safeguard Policy Statement requirements.
Implementation of the plan will be monitored by ADB’s sovereign operations department. ADB’s non-sovereign
borrower will undertake an environmental and social impact assessment to assess project impacts, however, no
additional involuntary displacement impacts are anticipated.
2. What action plan is required to address involuntary resettlement as part of the transaction TA or due diligence
process?
Resettlement plan Resettlement framework Social impact matrix
Environmental and social management system arrangement None |
| B. Indigenous Peoples Category A B C FI
1. Does the proposed project have the potential to directly or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood
systems, or culture of indigenous peoples? Yes No
2. Does it affect the territories or natural and cultural resources indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim, as
their ancestral domain? Yes No The impact assessment for the solar park project feasibility study
found no presence of distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples groups in the power plant project area.
3. Will the project require broad community support of affected indigenous communities? Yes No
4. What action plan is required to address risks to indigenous peoples as part of the transaction TA or due
diligence process?
Indigenous peoples plan Indigenous peoples planning framework Social impact matrix
Environmental and social management system arrangement None |
| V. OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES AND RISKS |
| 1. What other social issues and risks should be considered in the project design?
Creating decent jobs and employment (L) Adhering to core labor standards Labor retrenchment
Spread of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS Increase in human trafficking Affordability
Increase in unplanned migration Increase in vulnerability to natural disasters Creating political
instability
Creating internal social conflicts Others, please specify __________________

impact, (iii) participation dimensions, (iv) social safeguards, and (v) other social risks. Are the relevant specialists
identified? Yes No
2. What resources (e.g., consultants, survey budget, and workshop) are allocated for conducting poverty, social,
and/or gender analysis, and participation plan during the transaction TA or due diligence? The project is part of a
larger solar park project funded through a sovereign loan. ADB’s non-sovereign borrower will therefore benefit
from extensive project preparatory work already undertaken by ADB and EDC. The borrower will commission what
will essentially be an update to the solar park environmental and social impact assessment but based entirely on
its specific design and sub-contracting arrangements for construction and operation of the power plant. ADB will
review and approve this impact assessment as part of its due diligence.
